This repository contains the UMLS tagged version of the dataset for ICHI Medical Forum Classification Challenge.

It contains an implementation of Local Context Focus BERT with some experiments with BioASQ and glove embeddings as well.

Code is adapted from the huggingface transformers library.

Apologies for not well formatted README; will update it in coming weeks
