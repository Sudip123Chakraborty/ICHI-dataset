DISE	Bladder removal with neo bladder surgery	"My sister had invasive bladder cancer and had her bladder removed on Oct. 7th.    In the research I have done I get the impression that, in a woman since her urethra is so short, if any cancer is found in the urethra then the neo bladder should not be done and everything should be removed and the patient would have an external bag.    She went into this surgery assuming this would happen.    Her doctor found cancer in the urethra and cut it back three times until he got a clear frozen report.    Of course my sister has absolutely NO control since he shortened an already short urethra.    One week later the doctor comes into her hospital room and informed her that the final lab work showed she still had cancer in her urethra and also in the tube going to her kidney.    He said he could not go back in and do an external bag now because she would probably have uncontrollable diareahha for the rest of her life.    I asked if she would be having chemo and he said ""no""    He said they are just going to watch it.    My questions to you are as follows......Is he correct about diarehha?    Is he correct that surgery can't be done now?    Should my sister be going to another doctor who knows more about female bladder removal?    Am I correct that he should have removed everything as soon as he found cancer in the urethra?    Any answers and help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.    I am so sick about all this.    Thank you, Barbara"	bladder|kidney|cut|urethra|said|removal|chemo|shortened|back|external|correct

DEMO	Help with yeast/bv/herpes as docs are confusing me!	Hey girls, can anyone help.    Long story short, I am trying to get a diagnosis for herpes but the docs keep giving me different info about yeast and bv infections.    Can anyone help with a few questions?1    Can a yeast infection cause internal vaginal pain and swelling and redness?2    Can a yeast infection cause itchy outer vaginal lips that bleed a little when scratched?3    Can either yeast or bv cause a general hot blotchy rash that comes and goes in a day?4    Can either cause open cuts in and around the vaginal?5    Can a yeast infection cause swollen lymph nodes in the groin?Thanks a lot if you can help.    These aren't all my symptoms but the ones linked to queries over yeast/bv.    Thanks.    I'm so sick of being sick :(    Been 7 months now of recurring symptoms after a one night stand with someone who was 'clean'.

GOAL	Bob the trainer!!!!! Help please!	Dear Bob,I have just recently started teaching some classes at a gym I have no real fitness background,just my cert., which apparently is to be unspoken of. So I have been teaching about 8 cardio classes and 1 interval with weights and cardio. As well as the classes I have been making large efforts to eat correctly (carb+protien every time, 5-6 small meals a day, fruit only in the am or right after a workout, hold off on the dressings and the butter,ect.) Yet I feel bloated and like I'm actually getting larger. I have not had my body fat done recently, yet I did weigh-in 6 lbs lighter this last time I weighed-in (I don't do this but once every month or so cuz I can get a little compulsive) I feel that I may be overworking my body somedays, or other times like I'm stuck doing the same exercises i.e shoulders!    Before I started teaching I wasn't really working out regularly, so why does it seem like I am getting bigger if I lost the 6lbs and my body fat is droping? The growth is in my midsection and hips yet those are the number one area I work. (salsa dancing based classes 4 x's a week)    Any Ideas on how I could get shrinkage here?    I'm only 22 years old so please feel free to push me hard....... I am 5'6 and around 185lbs.    In high school I weighed 125-130 so this current weight is not well liked! Any advice or specific workouts would be helpful thanks!	exercises|ect|shoulders|midsection|body fat|body|hips|area I|weight|weights|weigh|right

TRMT	Band Removal	Has anyone had their lap band removed?    I am thinking about doing that because after having my band for 3 years I have gained my weight back and it is painful at times.    I really think that this is not for me.    As for those of you thinking about doing a lap band, you will loss weight but the way you eat will change forever and I feel weight loss can be achieved in a better way!    Also you can eat around the band over time meaning you will find ways to eat the foods that go down easy!	painful|weight|back
PREG	Anovulatory bleeding after M/C	"Hi Ladies,Here's a quick rundown of things.Missed M/C on April 11, 2011 (11w2d, carried for 15w2d)D&C on April 12, 2011**That was a Tusday and was done bleeding by SaturdayLast Monday I had some bleeding for 3 days (this was the first bleeding or spotting of any type since the D&C). It was light and a dark brown color. I thought that it was my period. However, yesterday I had some more bleeding. This time it was red in color and again light in flow and only lasted for a couple of hours.Had my levels tested 3 weeks ago and HcG was at a 28. Last week it was at an 11. Going in tomorrow for another retest.I called my OB about the bleeding and she told me it was most likely not a true period but an Anovulatory Period. Basically uterine bleeding with no ovulation. She also said that anovulatory bleeding can be very sporadic and vary in flow and color.Anyone else have experiences with this? I'm just worrying that the D&C somehow messed me up for good. I am 6 weeks post surgery. I want to start TTC again, but can't really do so if I'm not ovulating. My OB said it's normal, but I just don't know anything anymore. Going to wait and see where my levels are at tomorrow and then talk with her some more about when my ""real"" period should come.Thanks for any and all input."	anovulatory|said|ovulation|light|rundown|uterine|color

GOAL	Cataract surgery now or later?	I went to an opthomalogist to inquire about a Phakic IOL (I'm not a candidate for Lasik) and he discovered I have cataracts developing in both eyes and I'm only 42. The cataracts do not interfere with my vision yet, except for maybe nighttime driving. I'm happy with my corrected vision, just not with contacts. One surgeon suggested a Verisyse lense now and cataract surgery when I need it. Another (I sought a second opinion) suggested going ahead with cataract surgery now instead of a Phakic IOL, perhaps because insurance will cover part of the cataract surgery.After reading about multifocal lenses, I'm wondering if it would be worth waiting until multifocal lenses improve and wear contacts until I need cataract surgery.1) will multifocal lenses improve enough to make it worth waiting? what are the pros and cons of having surgery early?2) can monofocal lenses be removed easily with minimal risk if I later want a mutlifocal lense (when they improve) or I choose monovision and I can't adapt?3) What are the cons of monovision?Thank you for the information in this very confusing decision.	cataract surgery|eyes
GOAL	HCG	I have questions about the HCG Diet. My friend and I have been on the diet for 14 days.    I am feeling fine but not losing.    She is having some difficulty with hunger and since I prepare the food for both of us I need to know she is getting enough food.    I am using Fitday to figure out the calories, but wonder if there is a better site.Do taller people need any special adjustments?    I suggested that we are both in the adjustment phase and would get used to the limited amount of food, and that maybe she needed to take a little bit more of the hcg.    Neither of us is losing weight and are very strict with the diet.    Whe have done the plateau breakers.    Any suggestions?	feeling fine|hunger|adjustments|adjustment
FAML	3 yr-old touching genitals.. what are red flags	Ok, you can't blame if I freak out when I see this.    In my case it's just my husband and I, neither one has family, and my mom passed away 13 years ago.    So, I have no one to ask for advice. My daughter (3 Ã‚ ½ yr-old) recently started to touch herself, although, she does not do it all the time.    Mainly during bath time.    Here is my predicament:    After three weeks of being in a new daycare, she changed character COMPLETELY.    She became shy and did not want to talk, she peed three times in her pants after 6 month of being potty trained.    She would be afraid to go to bed.    She cried and cried for me to be there.    Also, she had never given me a problem staying at the daycare, but three days after being there, she would scream at the top of her lungs because she did not want to stay and grabbed my leg tight, she even started crying two blocks before we got there and the last week she was there, her teacher told me did not eat ANYTHING in the entire week.    So, of course I started to see red flags all over.    I've read sudden changes of characters like that are not normal.    At this time, she was not touching herself too much, just barely, if any.    I took her to see a child psychologist.    She examined her and ruled out any sign of abuse, instead, she pleaded that I take her out of that daycare.    That same day she told me that the big kids at the day care were bothering her.    Indeed I called the daycare, and they were short-staffed so they put her in the class w/ 3, 4, and 5 yrd-olds.    Also, at 3:30 p.m. they added to that group the after-schoolers who are even older.    I took her out immediately and put her in another daycare, and immediately her behavior became normal like magic.    Two weeks have passed, and now she is exploring herself in the genital area.    She does it during her bath time and seldom times when I change her underwear.    My concern is this:    after reading a lot about this topic, I learned that one of the red flags for sexual abuse is that kids start to show sexual behavior beyond their age.    Of course, I am totally ignorant in this topic, but to me, masturbating is beyond their age.    Please explain!    What behaviors should I be concerned about?	lungs|leg|lot|genital|bath|touching
FAML	wants a hug then she doesnt	i have a child who is very stubborn she likes to have her way and will throw a tantrum if she does get her way ive heard that if you ignore it she will eventually stop but in my case she will scream her head off for a few hours and she usally screams for her bottle a hug or    and when her dad goes to give her her bottle she dont want it same with a hug she will push us both away    she will scream till she has to go to the bathroom then i tell her to go to the bathroom again she will say no then i try take her by the hand to lead her to go to the bathroom again she will want my to pick her up to put her on the toilet so she can go but again she will say no. i dont know what to do when she does this and pushes us away right after asking for us or asking for a hug i dont know we have 10 month old i was thinking that maybe shes just acting out cause she sees her younger sister getting picked up and things like that can anyone tell me    if they have a simular case like mine?	head|hand|right

DISE	Pseudotumor without vision loss	Hi - I was wondering if anyone here has (or knows of) pseudotumor without optic disk swelling?I have a Chiari Malformation, and I'm nearly convinced that's my issue...but I won't completely ignore my doctors other ideas.    So the most recent theory is pseudotumor...the symptoms are very similar, but the one thing that is bugging me is that every time I hear about pseudotumor I hear about some degree of vision loss.I have problems with my eye muscles, which makes since for Chiari, but I do NOT have blurry vision, double vision, etc.    I have been told I have no optic disk swelling by an opthamologist, a neurosurgeon, and 2 neurologists.    Do weak eye muscles (one eye only, too) fit with pseudotumor?I am going to have an LP soon so I suppose that will answer my question...but I was just wondering what everyone else's experiences have been.Thanks!	eye muscles|optic disk|eye|symptoms|weak|fit

DISE	Pseudotumor Celebri	I was diagnosed with PC last November by a lumbar puncture/pressure test.    My pressure was signficantly high.    I am now taking 1,000 mg. Diamox daily.    I think I've had this for 27 years - going in and out of remission.    Going to doctors and being told nothing was wrong.    Now that I have a diagnosis I am relieved to at least know what my battle is. - but also wonder what the long term effects are.    I have terrible short memory, blurred vision very seldom, feel unbalanced when I walk and am chronically fatigued - which is my worst complaint.    Headaches are manageable, but feel that during the week I have episodes of the pressure going up.    I can feel it.    I get headaches and become very immobile, not even wanting to talk. Kinda of numb, if you know what I mean.    The Diamox kicks in and I'll be okay for a few more days.    This happends over and over and over.    The doctor says I'm not bad enough for surgery and I agree.    I am 5 ft. 1, I have lost 30 lbs. and now weigh 145.    I use the treadmill almost daily and walk 1 hour at 3.2 mph.    If I become dizzy within 30 minutes of the treadmill, then I stop.    Is this as good as I'm going to feel?    I'm tired of being tired, and am worried I might have brain damage from such a long term illness.    I also have chronic neck pain, which I've had for the last 27years.     Often, at night, when I lie my head down on my pillow, I can hear the fluids moving around -- a few moments then it stops.    I try not to worry too much about it.    I know it could be something worse.    I just want to know if I will ever feel like my normal energetic self again.    Thanking you in advance.	diagnosed|diagnosis I|treadmill|fluids|fatigued|illness|dizzy|tired|weigh|brain|head

GOAL	Vision after PPV	have a question about vision after PPV, gas bubble and laser....had PPV 2 months ago...my vision started slowly coming back almost 2 weeks ago....but slowly and baby steps of improvement in my vision.    My doc said i had a lot of blood in my eye which just started clearing up abuot 2 weeks ago.    Doc said i still have some blood left in the eye.    NOw however, i am starting to see medium/large objects, the outline of the road (clearer when the road is closer to me), cars, colors of objects, outline of trees.    But I still cant see far (used eye glasses and contacts before RD Surgery):Question:     How does one gradually get their vision back?    I noticed that my peripheral vision went back on first in the past week and a half.    but my focus is still blurred and is taking time.    I noticed that there is a light gray area when i look straight and try to focus..blocking my view.    It used to be thicker and darker before (the light gray area)... because I noticed that when I had the gas bubble shrink to a tiny perfect round ball...it used to get trapped around that light gray area).    will this eventually go away?    the light gray area seems to get a little bigger when I focus farther....i see all around the light gray area though but it is still blurred...but it is slowly getting better (baby steps of improvement....before i used to see just a dark gray area where an object is)...i also still see specs/dust of dried blood coming down/raining down my eye...not as much but I still see them coming down...Thank you in advance for your answer.    I really appreciate them.    .	back|said|light|gas|lot|eye|colors

DISE	Question about symptoms	Around two months ago out of nowhere I was hit with fatigue, heavy arms/legs, dizziness, double/blurring vision, confusion, coordination problems, and memory problems. These symptoms were strongest for about a week, then slowly subsided over around two weeks, with the fatigue coming back stronger now and then.Now after eight weeks my vision is still not completely clear, the main problem is what seems like double vision but is not clearly two images, the other problem is blurring of movement, like a trail behind a car or person walking past me. My walking coordination also does not seem right.After seeing a number of doctors, who believe it was a post viral fatigue due to a number of viruses I had in the preceding months, I have not got anywhere with this. A doctor has put me on anti-depressants for anxiety and depression, which may be helping, although I fell what I am experiencing is MS. I was also deficient in vitamin D, so I am taking supplements, so I'm not sure which one made me fell better.Further to this I have had a brain MRI which came back normal, initially thinking it may be a brain tumor. (Yes I know I have read about MRIs and MS)I have a neurologist appointment next week in an attempt to rule out MS.Has anyone experienced blurring of movement like I explained or know about it? It's not blurry vision as I can see very sharply, I have not been able to find anything on the internet about this. If I run my hand past my face it's like a delayed image following my hand. This occurs with both eyes, as does the double vision.I have seem an eye doctor (who sent me for the MRI) and he said that's weird. My eyes tested perfect.ThanksMark	post viral fatigue|said|deficient in vitamin D|dizziness|symptoms|confusion|brain MRI|brain|legs|hand|eyes|eye|arms|back|face|right

DISE	Unexpected withdrawal symptoms after quitting smoking.	"Hello all. I recently quit smoking (on Monday, it is now Friday). The first day I quit, I started exercising, I ran a mile on Tuesday, and 3 miles on wednesday. After my 3 mile run, i coughed up a very tiny amount of blood. I've given myself a couple days to rest after that, planning on starting up a daily 1 mile run tomorrow. That was the only time tho, I've only been coughing up the dark grey and light brown tar other than that.. I've also been having chest pains and intermittent shortness of breath, but not too bad. Today I just started experiencing what I would call a ""dry nose"" it feels like there's no moisture, but I also feel a constant, slow drip from my nose into my throat, with a little bit of blood in it. Should I be worried about anything? It seems like an internal nose bleed, i guess you could say.. I've also been drinking a half gallon of water every day since I quit. I don't have insurance or money, so I can't go to the doctor unfortunately.. I'm just trying to get some peace of mind here. Im only 19, I started smoking when I was 14. I don't have any family history of lung cancer, my grandmother and her mother both had breast cancer, but thats it. Both of my parents have smoked for 30+ years and they're still *healthy,* so I'm not too too concerned about cancer, i just want to make sure that what I'm experiencing isn't too abnormal..

FAML	What do we do about this behavior?	My stepson is a very intelligent 12 year old but lately he has decided he doesn't want to be responsible. He says he just wants to ignore every responsibility and have fun. He is now failing most classes, getting sent to the office constantly for not participating and doesn't realize that it's worse for him when he doesn't do his work.We're trying to help him understand the benefit from doing his work as opposed to the negative consequences that arise when he does not do it. He will sit in his room for hours staring at his homework because he does not want to do it. He cries and refuses to take any responsibility and when questioned, will most time shut down to where he won't speak and hangs his head. He will sit down in PE class and turn his back to everyone and ignoring his teachers. He will be sent to the principals office but will not learn from this behavior. He has started being disrespectful to his father, myself and his teachers. He lies, covers and hides things from us. We've tried various punishments (no video games, no TV, etc), reward systems and point systems (all of which he helps create and seems excited about initially). We make things in writing so he can visually see his progress but nothing we seem to do makes him accept any responsibility. It's frustrating because there is effort and trying on our part, but there is zero effort on the child's. Do we just let him fail now? Or what do we do? I feel we've tried all we can think of without even the slightest turn-around. We need help and advice...Thank you.	staring|head|back

I am new at this so please bare with me. I am having problems with my five year old. He is in Kindergarten this year and since the beginning of school he has had more bad behavior than good. Notes are being sent home everyday about the ""bad choices"" he makes wether it is hurtingother students,    not listening, or something else. I have talked to him and he understand what is he doing wrong but goes right back to doing it. I have tried everything i can think of to help him but nothing seems to be working. I have tried taking away things that he likes doing, we have tried a points chart for when he has good behavior, time out, and more but i cant find anything to help. I try to do everything that i think is best for him but nothing is helping. Any advice would be greatly appreciated i am at my wits in."	back|lot|right

DEMO	Vaginal air especially prior to period and very heavy bleeding, etc	The last year I've been having a of a lot of air escaping from my vagina, ususally when laying down at night on my back or even on my side. It is not due to having sex and I'm disabled and am not active physically at all, and I don't sit around with my legs apart or anything, so I don't know how air is coming from the outside in. This has been increasing in nature along with an increasing and unusal blood during my periods which are increasingly very thin blood that appears to be almost watery. (This last time of a lot of air coming out of my vagina I noticed happened the night before I got my period which even started out heavy.) I always have had very heavy period, especially the 2nd & 3rd days of it, but as this thin watery type blood has increased, so has the amount of blood that I lose during. I also have been mildly anemic which I assume is due to losing so much blood. I have what appears to be a normal disacharge of a clear, slippery nature, but it doesn't seen cycle specific. There is no odor from this discharge, nor from the air that comes out. My gyeno history includes persistent overy cysts and a slow growing fibroid. I do have many other health issues including an undiagnosed illness of chronic inflammation, chronic fevers and often night sweats, and a probable small fiber peripheral neuropathy, etc.(Ever since staph osteomyelitis of the spine 14 yrs. ago.)I'm negative for menopause,& any sexual infections and they don't think that I could still have staph in me all this time. Also I'm having increasing trouble with my bowels.Can any of this be related?	chronic fevers|neuropathy|vagina|cysts|osteomyelitis|increasing|illness|bowels|spine|legs|lot|back

FAML	getting my baby back to his routine	My baby is 3 months, He use to sleep for 4 hours on the first long stretch of sleep at night, than would wake up 3-2 hours later for the rest of the night. which was not bad.

SOCL	Who is Christine Odonnell?	"A watchdog group has filed official federal complaints against Tea Party candidate Christine O'Donnell, upset winner of Tuesday's GOP Senate primary in Delaware, and has labeled her a ""criminal"" for allegedly using campaign contributions for rent and other personal expenses.""Christine O'Donnell is clearly a criminal, and like any crook she should be prosecuted,"" said Melanie Sloan, CREW Executive Director. In complaints filed with the Federal Election Commission and the US Attorney's Office in Delaware, CREW alleges that O'Donnell used $20,000 in campaign funds to pay for living expenses in 2009 and 2010. ""By misusing campaign funds,"" said Sloan in a statement, ""Ms. O'Donnell committed the crime of conversion; by lying about her expenditures on forms she filed with the FEC, she committed false statements; and by failing to include the campaign funds she misappropriated as income, she committed tax evasion.RelatedWitch Says O'Donnell Is 'Misinformed' About WitchesO'Donnell Raises Nearly $1MMore from Brian Ross and the Investigative Team""Ms. O'Donnell has spent years embezzling money from her campaign to cover her personal expenses. Republicans and Democrats don't agree on much these days, but both sides should agree on one point: thieves belong in jail not the United States Senate.""The CREW complaint is based, in part, on the affidavit of former campaign aide David Keegan, who said that in 2009 O'Donnell was out of money and paid her landlord two months rent from campaign funds. O'Donnell called the expenditures ""expense reimbursements"" on FEC forms.According to Keegan, O'Donnell used campaign cash for meals and gas, and even a bowling outing.""If you need money to pay the rent and eat, you get a job; you don't start a Senate campaign so unsuspecting donors can support you,"" said Sloan.O'Donnell ran for senate in 2006 and 2008 as well. Just before voters went to the polls last Tuesday, Delaware residents received a recorded message from O'Donnell's 2008 campaign manager, Kristin Murray, paid for by the state's Republican Party, alleging that O'Donnell ""was living on campaign donations -- using them for rent and personal expenses, while leaving her workers unpaid and piling up thousands in debt. She wasn't concerned about conservative causes. O'Donnell just wanted to make a buck."""	polls|said|gas
DEMO	PCOS? abnormal ultrasound	My gyn hx consists of 2006 abn pap/abn colposcopy, & cone biopsy (showed dysplasia but got it all out), and now cervical stenosis from the cone. 2 mos ago during a visit to my former gyn for my ongoing battle with stenosis my Dr ordered a trans vag ultrasound. It showed that my R&L ovaries were abnormal and it stated that they showed multiple small follicles and that they were consistent with PCOS, it also showed a small fluid buildup from the stenosis which it stated was most likely blood trapped in the cervix. Over the past year I have gotten 2 previous US that showed my ovaries as being normal. My former Dr never explained this change to me, and I had to read it myself when I requested my records to go to a new dr for better stenosis treatment. My new dr is most concerned with getting another US next week to check out my fluid buildup from the stenosis, if there is any at all...I feel that I have been menstruating for the past 3 mos but not sure. I was on depo for 9 years and then switched to bc pills for three mos, and for the last mo I have been on nothing. I have never had my hormone levels tested either, Why don't docs do these tests when you have gyn probs or weight gain? 5 years ago I gained +60 lbs over 4-5 mos, and I have to wax my upper lip. Is this PCOS??? If the US showed those follicles on my ovaries what else could it be? My new dr will talk to me after the US next week, and I like to be prepared with questions, any advice is much appreciated?	colposcopy|ultrasound|treatment|fluid|upper lip|ovaries|cervix|follicles|weight|cervical|dysplasia

GOAL	Reocuring tendonities causing tight muscles	I've had reoccurring tendonitis for years, witch I believe was brought on from Hashimotos thyroid disease. When my thyroid labs are at the levels that work best for me, tendonitis is minimal. It could be possible (likely) that I have scare tissue on various tendon areas (muscles too) from being hypothyroid for years, so I    am continuously learning to improve this tightness condition.Unfortunately there is no place specifically on MH that I have seen for muscle and tendon issues (there should be). It is amaising how tight muscles or tendonitis in adjacent areas spread and cause pain in other areas - many are unaware of this. This prevents many physically active people from do whatever it is they like doing. I have practiced acupressure and trigger point therapy on whatever areas seem to be problematic - this works for treatment after tightness sets in, and is many times a way to prevent going to the chiropractor.    I am looking for a PREVENTIVE, to stop the occurrence if possible.Magnessium glycinate at night does offer some preventive care to lesson the chances of occurrence during and after exercise. B vitamins, D, Calcium suppliments seem to make no difference.After figuring out my thyroid condition with much help from the thyroid forum here (no thanks to Dr's), muscle and tendon discomfort might be my next 'mission'.I am otherwise in good physical condition, but this has always been a roadblock at times.Any experiences? What have others done? Any other supplement ideas?I have posted this in several related MH forums, since there is not one specifically for this.thanks	thyroid disease|hypothyroid|tendonitis|condition|Hashimotos|trigger point|acupressure|treatment|therapy|tendon|pain|discomfort

SOCL	Blood work	39 year old male.     Back in the fall of 2007 I had a routine physical. My blood work came back a bit off. WBC 3.9 (normal 4.2 to ...), RBC 4.36 (normal 4.5 - 6.0 ) and HGB 13.2 (13.5 - 17.8) HCT 38.8 (37-50 normal). Doctor didnt seem concerned and did a thorough physical exam.As I side note    I was effectively treated for Lyme Disease about 6 months prior.On my recent exam in the late fall my doctor went through all of the typical information with me including changes in family history. I told him that my dad was diagnosed at 73 with colon cancer.    after he had some bleeding he went for a colonoscopy and they found 3 large polyps one that turned out to be a superficial cancer . He had surgery to remove. no spread    no chemo etc.fully recoveredMy doctor suggested i get a colonoscopy Which is scheduled for next month. Recently i had additional blood work done work. After not hearing from him for a few weeks I called and he went over everything over the phone with me    he said    Everything is right where they want to see it (all normal according to lab). RBC 4.7 , WBC 4.4 HGB 13.9    HCT 39 etc.I plan on going for colonoscopy because its worth the preventive steps but my question is if an issue developed wouldnt my blood cell counts still be low or perhaps go lower.As one can imagine i am a bit nervous	Lyme Disease|said|diagnosed|hearing|nervous|chemo|Back|back|right

DISE	17 days post TT and doing well	Just noticed a post from Darla and her success after TT.    I thought I'd add one in two. I had mine August 30 and am also doing fine.    I think the successes should be heralded since I know prior to mine, I scanned a lot of boards looking for people's experiences.    For a while it seemed there weren't a lot of good ones.Dr. Mark said in one, that most people don't write when things go well, so sometimes it makes it look like the frequency of complications is more than it is.Anyway, mine was a TT due to nodules on both lobes, one of which was about 1CM that looked 'highly suspicious,' the other two were .9 and .7. One was cystic, the other 'suspicious.' The first and second opinion labs couldn't agree on what type, follicular or papillary.Even with insulin dependent diabetes, I had a good surgery with no complications. Was very sore, and am still a little hoarse.    It was difficult to swallow for about a week, often felt like something stuck in my throat, but was more of an annoyance than anything else.Path came back as papillary carcinoma, one nodule had begun to grow outside of the thyroid, so I'm glad they got it out.    There were two other spots in addition to the other nodules.Am on 100 mcg of Synthroid, and feel great.Am meeting with Radiation Oncologist on Friday to plan RAI ablation treatment.    They will be using Thyrogen, rather than withdrawal from thyroid. Although this is an 'off the box' method still I think, it is being done standardly at major places such as Univ of Penn, etc.I went back to work after about 9 days.Sent a plant to my endo who had discovered the lumps.    This was significant, since I had just been at my GP 2 weeks before, and my former endo three months before!

TRMT	Reaction from vaccine given	My new doctor carelessly gave me a pneumonia vaccination( PPV) too early following one given 2 years earlier.He did not check my records or ask me if I had the shot before. CDC says 3 years minimum time between shots.I had a terrible reaction as the old shot seemed to be fighting off the new one: severe total arm redness and arm swelling twice the normal size, alternating chills and fever, sleeplessness, cramping muscles, nausea, headache and general body aches and pains. Has lasted for a week now but better each day.Will there be permanent immune system damage due to this? If so, anything I can do to offset it? What health issues can I expect in the future from this dumb mistake?Thanks so much for informed and serious answers.	cramping muscles|sleeplessness|chills|nausea|aches|pains|body|arm|pneumonia|severe|vaccination
PREG	Scary week	So last Thursday I get a headache and it wouldnt go away. Friday I started swelling, had headache, was dizzy and felt overall like crap. Saturday and Sunday were the same and I had even called the OB on Friday only for them not to be too concerned. According to my scale I had put on literally 10lbs in 2 days. So finally I get up today..headache gone and swelling disappeared as well and my weight is back down. My cuz thinks I may have had an elevated blood pressure and that is bad cuz it could lead to preeclampsia. So my questions are..when do I start to worry if my doc's office didnt seem too worried about it and should I push for a doc visit to check next time (*hoping their is not a next time*)?Also...they called my in Lorecet 7.5 to help with the headache but I refuse to take them since I am pregnant and those are narcotics. I cant believe they would prescribe those to an expectant mother!	weight|dizzy|back|overall
TRMT	Starting Bone Marrow Transplant	My son is being admitted in the hospital tomorrow    to start his chemo and bone marrow transplant.I'm so scared for him ! !     He will be on three different chemo treatments and methrotrexate for a few days..    The doc's say 40% ofpeople don't make it through.Does anyone know what the chances are with AML?Has anyone gone through a bone marrow transplant?Is it very difficult pulling through it?The doc's say he needs a good attitude about this or he won't make it.So afraid of losing him.    I searched all over the internet to find someone who went through this, and try to get sometips, that I may be able to help him through this, but couldn't find any information or support.    He feels like he's all alone.	transplant|treatments|chemo|transplant?Is|or support|marrow|bone
FAML	frequent and urgent bladder condition	"my daughter is soon to turn 5 in march and for the last 6 months has slowly developed what i believe to be a behavioral pattern.    it started with a ""bladder infection"" we went to the doctor, the urinalysis came back negative.    it went away for a few months and then has reoccurred every now and again.    she started wetting the bed, wetting her pants and then complaining about having to go to the bathroom all the time.    we go and nothing comes out.    she has started to throw complete tantrums over having to go to the bathroom.    5 times in 1 hour, only to squirt a little out here and there.    we have gone to the doctor, he suggested cystitis, we treated her for that.    there is no fever, no painful urination, it doesn't burn, no stomach ache.    if i get her mind off of it she will change her focus and on occasion has been proud of herself for holding her pee.a lot of changes have occurred in our lives, we had another child (now 15 months), my mother has had a stroke and now lives with us.    so our family dynamic has changed.    however, we spend every day together.    i am truly at witts end.    the doctor has referred us to a specialist, which i am for it if there is a physical problem.    i am more inclined to believe it is behavioral due to its inconsistency (one day is horrible the next three are fine)....has anyone else had this happen?    please advise....."	painful urination|stomach ache|infection|stroke|cystitis|bladder|lot|back
FAML	uncontrolable muscle movements	My 2 year old son has been doing these involantary movements when he is excited or sees something he likes . His arms and shoulders shake and now he has started to shake his legs and feet also his bottom jaw drops down . This is mostly triggered by the    movement.of something .he wont go past a door if we are out anywhere he has to stop at it and watch it open and close...he gets very upset when I try to move him away from it. Other than that his speech is fine , he has a great memory for words ,shapes and numbers .We have just started a mother toddler group and he just sat watching other kids go down the spiral chute doing his shaking of arms and legs obviously the movement was triggering this off..a few of the mums were commenting to me how 'excited ' he was looking. he did eventualy go down the chute himself and play around. I would just like to know should I be concerned? His dad keeps saying he will grow out of it but he seems to be doing it more and more	legs and feet|arms and legs|jaw|shoulders|arms|shaking|shake|watching|speech
SOCL	WWYD?!?!?!?!	"I have a question about something school-related. My daughter (4 yrs old) just started preschool Monday and I'm already a little perturbed by a few things. My question is, do I write the teacher a note and have my daughter give it to him? Or do I wait until things smooth out as school literally JUST started?These are the things that have bothered me:-My daughter came home sock-less on the first day. They are nowhere to be found.    ???-I packed her a lunch and told them on the first day. They gave her school lunch AND her packed lunch (but didn't charge me because of the mixup). So the Lunchable she had eagerly picked out at the store with me was entirely ruined because she ate the school lunch instead.-They wanted to put all the kids' naptime bedding (blankets and pillows) in a PILE TOGETHER. Is it just me or is this completely unsanitary?! Some of the bedding didn't look washed at all. So I told the teacher assistant on the first day, ""PLEASE find another place for my daughter's bedding. I do not want it in the pile; that's unsanitary."" I get told that's perfectly fine. When I pickup my daughter I find her bedding in the BOTTOM of a huge pile. They're working on building cubbies for them but in the meantime that's just gross.-This school wears uniforms. We're to provide extra clothes in the event our child has an accident or gets dirty. So I packed an extra uniform as her extra. We were told on the first day that we could use regular clothes as the extra. So today I bring a regular old outfit and ask to have her extra uniform returned via her backpack so she could wear it the next day. WELL... someone removed the extra clothes but didn't return the uniform?! What the heck?! Uniforms are not cheap and we have a limited amount.-My daughter is allergic to strawberries. She told me they gave her strawberries in her school lunch on Monday. It won't kill her; just make her break out into hives. BUT still, that's a pretty important issue. Food allergies should be taken seriously no matter how intense they are.-I have no idea what my child does everyday. I don't have a letter sent home stating, ""This is when we have lunch. And this is when we do circle time. And this is when we do reading time, etc., etc."" Routine is so important to small children. I'm interested to know the class routine so we can try to stick somewhat to the same routine (for naps and eating) to make the transition easier. I'm just not getting any communication. But then again, it's only day 2.So what would you do? I'm very new to this. I've never put a child in school before. Do I wait until things calm down this first week? Do I go to the principal and voice concerns (this is their FIRST year doing a preschool at this school so they obviously have kinks to work out)? Or should I just send her teacher and assistant a reminder that I need her uniform, missing socks and to please keep bedding separated (can we say gross germs, flus/colds, head lice)? I don't want to be THAT parent that is just always griping and unsatisfied with something. But I also want my daughter to have a healthy and safe year and I want to know what is going on in the classroom. HELP!I'm pregnant so it is easy to over-react about things and become paranoid. But I would think that the bedding and allergy thing are pretty major."	head lice|hives|colds|PILE|pile|flus|allergic to strawberries|packed|reminder|backpack

TRMT	Ileostomy reversal	My mom just had a ileostomy reversal last Wednesday.    The reason for the ileostomy was a dead bowel but the surgeon said there was enough left for him to reattach when she was strong enough.    She is 83 with a few health issues--pacemaker, moderate blockage of a couple of arteries in her heart, this and that.    She did have a UTI right before her surgery and they found a little cyst on her pancreas--not low enough for the surgeon to do a biopsy but after the reversal surgery, surgeon said he felt pancreas and he felt it was fine and doctor said get through this recovery first and watch the cyst.    He felt it was benign but of course would not guarantee 100%.    Recovery going a little slow and when the first 3 bowel movements came out bloody my mom was convinced it was cancer despite reassurance.    She also has not been hungry and she thinks she is losing hair (beautician told her before anasthetic can do that) which she feels are also signs.    I'm afraid her attitude is going to be a self fulfilling prophecy and not what she needs for recovery--she thinks we are all holding something back from her.    Are these symptoms normal--particularly bloody stools and no appetite?    Also, while all the doctors said she could eat anything she wanted after the ileostomy, we learned there were foods (like nuts and corn, etc.) that could cause obstructions or blockages of the stoma.    Now they're saying she will be able to eat anything again--is this true, or are we going to learn down the road there are foods she needs to avoid?

SOCL	Romney makes nearly $57,000 a day	"When Romney decided to ""release the Quicken"" Tuesday morning, the nation finally learned what he is really worth. Turns out, he made over $43 million in 2010 and 2011 combined -- and paid just $6 million in taxes. That makes his tax rate 13.9%, approximately what someone making $50,000 a year who isn't a venture capitalist might pay.Right off the bat, Stewart realized how trivial the infamous $10,000 bet Romney made with Perry back in December really was (""I'll bet you whatever I make in the time it takes me to finish this sentence,"" he mocked). But what really made Stewart mad was the fact that Romney makes nearly $57,000 a day, more than most Americans see all year, and he doesn't even want his current job.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/jon-stewart-takes-on-mitt-romney-tax-return-video_n_1230530.html"	back

DISE	perapherial neuropathy and low b12????	Hi all,My doctors have said that I have low B12 (225) and that is what is causing my numbness, tingling and burning in my feet, legs, hands and arms.    More on my left side than right.    I have been taking the B12 shots for 4 months now and last week my neuropathy issues got worse!    Neuro Dr. said take the shot 1x a week for a month instead of 1x a month and my primary dr prescribed neurontin to ease the burning.My question is does this all seem normal?    I mean, my levels are not below normal but are low so can I have the issues that I have with that?    Everything that I read on PN says I have more than just normal PN since I get the burning with it and now it is spreading/getting worse while being treated?    I have also started taking an antidepresant because of the stress from all this.    Should I just go with what the Dr's are saying or find 2 new dr's and start over?

I feel warm like I have a fever but it is ok when I take it.I have to go in today to see her and she wants to blame everything on depression.

It took me three months to find a docter I was comfortable with and finally decided to remove the malformation from my brain. I am now seven weeks post op and doing fine. No complications.

FAML	5yr old with various problems	"My fiancee's 5 yr. old daughter has been exhibiting various behavioral problems on and off over the last 6 months.These problems range from crying at everything that happens (she drops a toy on the floor, she cries; her shoe falls off, she cries)... almost anything at any time! She has also been pooping in her pants on and off for the last few months (she doesn't like to go potty, both #1 and #2, and does all she can to avoid it for some reason). She has recently taken to ""mouthing off"" to both of us when we try to tell her things even just during normal conversations, not just when we correct her for something.We are at a loss as to why most of these things have been occurring. She's a really great little girl, but lately this behavior is getting worse and more frequent. We have discussed taking her to a doctor, but are some of these behaviors normal, physical behaviors or does she need some sort of psychological help?Her father is only in her life when he finds it convenient for himself and I'm sure some of this may have something to do with some of these things but what can we do to get her back on track?"	back|potty|correct

SOCL	why won't my boyfriend have sex with me?	I'm 18 and have been dating my boyfriend for a year next month. He is 22.    Yes i am a virgin, and no he isn't a virgin. I don' want to be a virgin anymore because i am almost 19 and its not just because of that but i reallly do love him and i think he may be the one, when i asked him when are we going to try to have sex he gets alll mad at me and says he is not ready.    He has 2 past girlfriends before me and he had sex with both of them a lot, why not me? Is it because im a virgin? Back in june he cheated on me with his ex girlfriend he told her he wanted sex with her but she refused to and wouldn't do it, but he tried to so technically he didn't cheat on me but in a way he did because i know if she said yes they would of. It was wrong for him to even ask to begin with but the point is why did he go to her and not me? My friend said maybe because he respects me and just wanted a piece of *** from her because he thought she was an easy target, could that be true? He told me once he never masterbrated before. Is that weird? I found that very weird. It's like he has no sex drive. I do love him a lot that hes not perverted and using me like most guys but sometimes i wish he would want sex with me. I know he's not gay at least i don't think so. I'm not fat or anything a lot of guys think im pretty he says i am but why won't he ever try to sleep with me? Like i said before when i ask him he tells me hes not ready, he said because his last gf it was all about sex and he doesn't want that again, but we been toghter for almost a year and we haven't done it once and he said because he wants it to mean something he wants it to be special to him. So then i ask him was it special to your with your past girlfriends? Why was it special to them and not me now? He never really answerd the question was it special to them or not but im taking it as a yes. I need advice is it me or him? Why won't he have sex with me or anything? We hold hands, we kiss and we get along great just he won't have sex with me. he said because his 2 past girlfriends were all about sex and then the relationship fell apart because thats all they were about. He said he really loves me and he doesn't want our relationship fall apart because of sex he says sex can break a relationship. He said he doesn't want it to be just another girl he wants it to be love next time. So hes saying he doesn't love me enough to have sex with me but he always tells me he loves me? Does this make any sense? Could any of this be true?	hands|lot|Back|said|sense

PREG	Play by Play L&D Update	So, I'm assuming I'm the first in our community to post while in the L&D room!    Yeah I'm a geek to have brought the laptop.    (I brought it to distract myself and the DH/DD, as well as keep up in touch, great connection with the hospital as far as WiFi and they are totally cool about it).Anyhow, they gave me the Cervidil at 9-9:30am this morning... it's now nearly 6pm.. and about an hour ago I was asking for pain medication.    Supposedly that is a good sign according to the doc/nurses.    So, they gave me Nubdol or something like that (my mental state is slightly altered right now after all) and so I'm still feeling the contractions but it took the edges off for the most part.	right

GOAL	HCG update	"HCG (Generic name: Human chorionic gonadotropin)Pregnyl by Organon. 5,000 to 20,000 IU (International Units) per 10 cc vials. This drug is not a steroid but it is widely used in athletics today. HCG is a natural protein hormone secreted by the human placenta and purified form the urine of pregnant women. This hormone is not a natural male hormone but mimics the natural hormone LH (Luetinising Hormone) almost identically. This LH stimulates the production of testosterone by the testis in males. Thus HCG sends the same message and results in increased testosterone production by the testis due to HCGÃ¢ € ™s effect on the leydig cells of the testis. not sure how this would affect fat cells ? nor weight loss ? Normally this HCG is used to treat women with certain ovarian disorders and it is used to stimulate the testis of men who may be hypogonadal. Athletes use HCG to increase the bodyÃ¢ € ™s own natural production of testosterone which is often depressed by long term steroid use. Also when steroids are used in high dosages they can cause false signals to the hypothalamus that results in a depressed signal to the testicles. Over a period of weeks of this depressed signal the testicles ability to respond to any signal from the pituitary becomes very weak, which results in testicular atrophy. again...whats this got to do with fat loss ?To avoid this athletes will use HCG to keep an artificial signal going to the testis and preventing testicular atrophy. When administered, HGC raises serum testosterone very quickly. A rise in testosterone firs appears in about two hours after injecting HCG. The second peak occurs about two to four days later.HCG therapy has been found to be very effective in the prevention of testicular atrophy and to use the bodyÃ¢ € ™s own biochemical stimulating mechanisms to increase plasma testosterone level during training. Some steroid users find that they have some of their best strength and size gains while using HCG in conjunction with the steroids. This may wee be due to the facts that the body has high level of natural androgens as well as the artificial steroid hormones at that time.The optimal dosage for an athlete using HCG has never been established, but it is thought that a single shot of 1000 to 2000 IU per week will get the desired results. Cycles on the HCG should be kept down to three weeks at a time with an off cycle of at least a month in between. For example, one might use the HCG for two to three weeks in the middle of a cycle, and for two or three weeks at the end of a cycle. It has been speculated that the prolonged use of HCG could repress the bodyÃ¢ € ™s own production of gonadotropins permanently. This is why the short cycles are the best way to go.The side effects from HCG use include gynecomastia, water retention, and an increase in sex drive, mood alterations, headaches, and high blood pressure. HCG raises androgen levels in males by up to 400% but it also raises estrogen levels dramatically as well. This is why it can cause a real case of gynecomastia if dosages get too elevated for that person. Another side effect seen from HCG use is morning sickness (nausea and vomiting). There have been no cases of overdose complications with the use of HCG nor have there been any associated carcinomas, liver or renal impairment. HCG was at one point looked at to see if it could carry the AIDS virus, due to the fact that it is biologically active, but the latest word is that this could not be possible in any way. So we see how HCG be used by athletes to avoid some of the problems associated with abruptly stopping a steroid cycle. This product is also not picked up on steroid tests, so some athletes use it to keep androgen levels high before a contest that has drug testing. HCG must be refergerated after it is mixed together, and it then has a life of about 10 weeks. It is taken intramuscularly only; this drug is often available by order of a physician if you show symptoms of hypogonadism. It is hard to find on the black market.now I know most will say this is big athletes...but that's not true..nor change the facts about this product..with all do respect...after 25 people..(3 top pro athletes) many many reports..books..info...me my self..would 100% not take this..and in no way do I think it can help with weight loss....with all due respect..till I see solid proof Im wrong..that's my opinon.""The Lord is on my side;I have no fear."" -psalm 118:6[/b]"	nausea and vomiting|morning sickness|headaches|symptoms|weight|weak|renal impairment|hypogonadism|disorders|virus|AIDS|as artificial|prevention|mimics|therapy|chorionic|order|testicles|pituitary|ovarian|liver|body|hypothalamus|active|testosterone|protein

DISE	Unusual Symptoms	"Hello everyone, id like just to query a few of the symptoms I am having as they are very different to anything ive experienced before.I havent been feeling myself for approx a month now. I first went into hospital suffering from heart palpitations, panic attacks and a general feeling of horrid. I stayed in 2 days where they monitored my heart to find nothing major, they also conducted plenty of blood tests and found no clot etc.After I came out, I felt pretty good, the palpitations were decreasing but I had a strange sensation of feeling unusual/spaced out. I visited the doctor a few more times as I looked and felt like hell. I had tingling/pins and needles in my leg and also small vision issues.The doctors told me it was anxiety, and all of the symptoms matched up. I was not on any medication and was told to wait until I had received a 2 week monitor of my heart. This passed and I felt almost back to normal, until I started developing headaches.The headaches began very dull, behind my left eye and at the back of my head. They did not prevent me from working, socialising or doing any normal task. I took 2 paracetemol every few days which cured it. I also had trouble with my pupils changing size constantly, which thought I might have vision problems. I had my eyes checked and they were fine, slightly short sighted etc but generally all good. There was no pressure behind the eyes and no retina issues.When I had the headaches at first, I felt ""sober"" as I like to call it, except obviously having a dull/constant pain which seemed normal headaches.The headaches over the past few days seemed to develop....on Monday, I had the usual headache which seemed to be fine until I got in the bath and suddenly felt completely out of it, nothing brought it on at all. I was shaky, couldnt focus my vision and semeed just out of it. I went to bed, woke up the next day and was fine.After waking up the headache came on, left sided towards the back after about an hour. I ignored it, took 2 paracetemol at dinner time then it got worse....it seemed to build up until all of a sudden it felt like a firework had gone off in my head. My head was tingling immensely but the headache had gone, my arms/legs tingled and I once again felt all over the place. I developed speech problems and couldnt seem to function 100%.Today was the worst, I woke up with a completely numb head, no pain but extremely tingly. I have been freezing cold all day and also suffered from what seemed ""inner"" shivers.I started taking propanalol yesterday just as a note.I havent had any scans, went to the doctors and they basically shudded me off again with ""Anxiety"". I do worry about my health, but these symptoms just seemed a lot more severe than anything id ever experienced. Does anyone have any ideas?Thanks."	strange sensation|pins and needles|headaches|symptoms|pain|short sighted|retina|tingling|left eye|scans|pupils|heart|head|eyes|legs|leg|lot|back|arms|bath|severe

SOCL	Will you wear blue??	Blue Fridays.Very soon, you will see a great many people wearing blue every Friday. The reason? Americans who support our troops used to be called the 'silent majority' We are no longer silent, and are voicing our love for God, country and home in record breaking numbers. We are not organized, boisterous or overbearing.Many Americans, like you, me and all our friends, simply want to recognize that the vast majority of America supports our troops. Our idea of showing solidarity and support for our troops with dignity and respect starts this Friday -- and continues each and every Friday until the troops all come home, sending a deafening message that every red-blooded American who supports our men and women afar, will wear something blue. By word of mouth, press, TV -- let's make the United States on every Friday a sea of blue much like a homecoming football game in the bleachers. If every one of us who loves this country will share this with acquaintances, coworkers, friends, and family, it will not be long before the USA is covered in BLUE and it will let our troops know the once 'silent' majority is on their side more than ever, certainly more than the media lets on. The first thing a soldier says when asked 'What can we do to make things better for you?' is .'We need your support and your prayers.' Let's get the word out and lead with class and dignity, by example, and wear something blue every Friday.I recieved this in an email and wanted to pass it along.    This is not meant in any way to be a political debate post.    Just meant for those who do support our troops to spread the word.    If you don't, disregard.You can check my journal for the full email.	
FAML	5 year old's bahavior vastly worse at mom's...	"My ex-wife and I have been separated for a little over 2 years now. We have joint physical and legal custody, and have a schedule where he is with one or the other every 2-3 days... its a lot of bouncing back and forth for him, but we live close and it keeps him in both of our lives without too much time away from the other.My ex-wife is still single, works from home (tho is almost always out at appointments) and is quite fanatical about her work. When we were together I joked that she swore an oath to her company, as opposed to merely taking the job.I live with the woman I've been dating for 2 years, and we're getting married in 3 weeks. We provide a very stable home for my son (as well as hers). Oh, my son is 5 (6 in 3 months) and her son is 6 (he's 8 months older). We have lots of rules, but we also have lots of fun. We eat dinner at the kitchen table nearly every night, kids have a relatively strict bedtime, lots of rules about proper manners and behavior, but they have plenty of freedom to play, express themselves, and have fun.My son is pretty well behaved at my home. Minor issues here and there, and he usually catches himself breaking a rule, and says ""Oops sorry!"". Our kids rarely fight, and its even more rare that it's physical. He has issues at school (kindergarten) but thats more an issue that my son is high energy and cant keep his mouth shut ;)However, when he is with his mother (and this is all from her, as told to me, on the phone looking for answers) he acts like a baby.A list of common issues:Constant getting out of bed, often asking to sleep in hers with her (my house: he stays in bed)Baby talkWanting to cuddle almost constantly and crawling into her lapThrowing temper tantrumsYesterday he had strawberries for dessert, and put sticky pink handprints all over her walls...He's tried to blackmail her (give me what I want or I'll annoy you til you do!)She picked him up from school yesterday and he had poked holes in his uniform shirt (private christian school) with a pencil.NONE of these things he does at my house.Now, I've read a few things, I've been told a few things about it, but before I say what I've heard/read/been told I'm looking for thoughts and opinions here.He's a totally different child when he's with her. With me, he's relatively well behaved, hes relatively respectful, and very polite. With her he turns into a baby.And just to be clear - we're not warmongers! This kid has freedom to have fun at my home. Heck, we just got a puppy which he loves dearly. We get season passes to a local amusement park every year. We took the kids to Disney last summer... he's not in a military boot camp! He has rules and structure, and he does well.Any obvious reasons or thoughts as to why he's so... different... with her?"	back|lot|and structure
DEMO	Poor immune system?	Our daughter is 20 months old. She had two heart defects at birth and had a really rough start. We notice that she is frequently ill. In the last 10-12 months (ever since she stopped receiving Synagis) she has had croup 8x, she's had several sinus/upper respiratory infections, 3 or 4 ear infections, a throat infection, a couple 24 hour fevers, and now, just this past week, all in one week she developed: ear infection, oral thrush, a vaginal yeast infection, and then a viral rash. The virus then prompted a thrombocytopenia reaction (her platelets dropped). Thankfully they came back up on their own after a few days. Today's CBC and platelets came back normal.Does this sound like a typical stuff for a toddler (she's in an in-home daycare with only 2 other children, two days a week)?

DEMO	Lower right side abdominal pain	My 15 year old daughter has been having severe, sharp shooting pain in her lower right abdomen, sometimes shooting around to the back.    We had her in the ER, they did a CT and an Ultrasound, both came out with negative results.    It was not appendix, no ovarian cysts (although her right ovary is a bit larger than the left), no intestinal blockage.     The pain comes and goes, but she is very uncomfortable.    In a follow up with her physician, he felt the tests were done very well and accurate.    The only thing he did feek was a slight swelling of some lymph glands in the area, but it should go away eventually.    The pain is still bothering her and I do not know where to turn.    The Dr. said it could be stress, but she really is not under any stress.    She is not sexually active.    Who do I turn to for a second opinion?    What type of physician should I look for?

GOAL	Red itchy swollen eyes	I've been reading everyone's comments and it seems we have similar eye problems.    Red swollen itchy sometimes scaly eyes.    I have never had any problems and developed this eye problem a year and a half ago.    My doctors have there ideas of what it is but....they don't seem to suffer from my problem and I really don't think putting cortizone cream on my eyelids is a great idea.    I was also on a diet of drinking water and not eating any sugar, salt , flour, wheat, soy, tomatoes, potatoes, pork...etc.    I'm small to begin with and taking away almost all my food didn't seem to help either but desperate times call for desperate measures.    Funny thing last october I was on vacation for 3 weeks with my husband and it completely cleared within a few days.    When I returned it was back to the same routine of swollen itchy eyes that swell up and down on a weekly basis.    This year we went away for 3 and a half weeks and same thing it completely cleared up in 3 days but as soon as we returned it was back within 2 days.It is obviously something in our house I am reacting to.    Has anyone else come to this conclusion and what have they done to help with the problem?We are thinking of putting an air exchanging unit in our home as well as an air purifier.The only concern I have with this route is....I have lived here for 6 years and this problem has developed within the last year and a half.    Is it possible to develop a reaction after living in a home for that long?Any help would be greatly appreciated.Sincerely,Paula	air purifier|eyelids|eyes|back
GOAL	Tooth extraction about 30 hrs ago.	Hi, I had my Number 3 tooth taken out, molar on the upper right, and the Dr. told me that bleed that day is normal but i can't recall if he said it would still bleed the day after.Anyways, My question is, Is bleeding normal the day after?? i'd assume maybe some pinkish on the gauze and in saliva,    But occasionally it looks a bit of a darker red, is that normal??    I worry way to much for my own good so i'm hoping that's what it is.Also, how can i tell if everything is going right?? I'm freaking out about getting a dry socket, but that doesn't seem to be any sort of a problem.    When i look at where the tooth was it looks a bit blackish and red, its kind of hard to see.	dry socket|said|tooth|molar|right
SOCL	My doctor dropped me	My doctor sent me a letter stating that he was no longer accepting me as a patient. He said the reason was non compliance since I refused to go to pain managment. The only thing is that I did go to pain managment but they said that since my physical therapist didn't think I'd be in pain for longer than a month or so (I have back issues) they didn't see a reason for me to be there. They sent me back to my original doctor and then I get a letter stating they dropped me. I called a lawyer but they said nothing could be done. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? I would normally just get a new doctor but this doctor is part of IA Health Systems in Iowa and now I can't see a doctor in any of their facilities. Which is everywhere!

FAML	Concerned about my nephew's behavior/attitude towards me and my family	I have a 2 1/2 year old nephew who cries EVERY SINGLE TIME he see's me or my family - it started when he turned one, he will not allow us to hold him, touch him, play with him or interact with him in any way, shape or form. When my brother and sis in law come to my house, my nephew cries and refuses to come inside, he does the same when they visit my parents. When we talk to him or want to give him a toy he gives us the dirtiest looks and spits at us - If I or my parents visit him in HIS house, he reacts the same way, he grabs us by the shirt and walks us to the door (crying) like saying 'GET OUT' .. and as if this wasn't painful enough for us, we've noticed that our presence triggers aggression in him, he will physically lash out at his mother and father (kick them, hit them) as if he's mad at THEM for allowing us inside the house. I know it sounds like he's a spoiled brat but he's really not, my brother and sis in law just say 'dont mind him, he's cranky because he hasn't napped/eaten' ...but EVERY TIME?? This situation is literally tearing my family apart, he is the first nephew/grandson we love him to pieces and it's very upsetting because we see how upset our presence makes my nephew, the tears cannot flow out of his eyes fast enough, it's not like he's pretend crying ...I realize that it's impossible to give a diagnosis without personally evaluating him, I just want to know if there is cause for concern ... thank you so much	presence|painful|eyes

DISE	Why can't I stop thinking about dying during ablation?	I am having my ablation in 2 weeks. I read that appromimatly 0.1-0.3% of people die during the procedure. Is that alot compared to the chances of my SVT's killing me.? Or compared to risks of other surgeries.. My doc says SVT is not life threatening, but more a quality of life issue. I guess what scares me is that I only have episodes every 3-4 weeks and the flutters sometimes so I am trying to weigh out what is right for me...I am so scared.	procedure|surgeries|ablation|SVT|weigh|right

PREG	IF at Risk for Miscarriage do I stay on bedrest?	According to my last period I should be 8wks this Friday, this is my first pregnancy. I went to my Dr Monday for my first sonogram and no bay just the yolk in the sac....so I was told I needed blood tests and may be only 5 wks along or at risk of miscarriage. I was asked to come back today for more blood tests but in the meantime I started spotting dark brown yesterday morning and cramps started in too, the cramps have not stopped at all and this morning I passed a long blood clot....I have been so nervous....My Dr wanted to see me right away rushed the blood work and did an exam. The good news is my HCG levels went up 60% but she said my uterus is shedding and gave me progesterone to help make this a viable pregnancy. She said it is a waiting game and told me warning signs    of a miscarriage and asked me to go back next wednesday for a sonogram...she was very imformative but I did not ask if I should take it easy, she did not mention anything about bedrest but I am reading a lot of similar stories where bedrest was suggested...I plan to take it easy, I am scared and am praying I keep this baby, we have been trying for so long!	sonogram|bedrest|rushed|nervous|cramps|uterus|said|back|lot|right

DISE	Appointment with Special Specialist.	I went to the new pain specialist today. I was prepared to be unimpressed, since I have had such bad luck with Neurologists. He asked all kinds of pointed questions for over an hour, looked my notes.Did a Neurological exam. Explained what my body was doing with the exam and why that was important. He asked why it took all these Neurologists a lifetime to see what he sees. He asked why no one has taken it any further to find out more of the mystery to where the disconnect between the brain and the spinal cord is and try to help me. He could not understand why it took an LP to finally give me a diagnosis of MS.He explained my nerves are being told to rapid fire all the time. Basically I have clonus everywhere. He was puzzled why they did so many Brain MRIs and went no further. Also why they have not really been trying to treat it or even explain it to me.He is also conservative and does not want to do more harm or turn me into a Zombie to get rid of spasms.I have real hope.Alex	brain and spinal cord|nerves|body|clonus|spasms|pain|Brain

FAML	Son will only go in potty at home.	"For the past 1 1/2 months we've been potty training my now 3 yo son. At home he is wonderful. Wears big boy undies all throughout the day, and only has maybe 2 or 3 accidents a week, most of those only due to not getting to the potty in time. He still wears pullups for bedtime, which we are working on, but it's going along great. But we have a problem. He refuses to use the potty at school. He just throws temper tantrums the entire time the teacher tries to get him to go on the potty, and refuses to sit down and go pee. I don't understand it at all because he goes all by himself at home with no problems. Today I decided to try sending him in with ""special"" school big boy undies to see if that will motivate him, but I called the teacher to see how it is going adn he still refuses to use the potty and has gone through 2 pairs of undies and pants already.Does anyone have any suggestions on what else we can do to help him use the potty at school? There are other children in his class who use the potty too, so it's not like he's the only one who has to use it? Thanks in advance!"	Today|potty

FAML	3 1/2 yr old. girl pees on the floor	"Our 3 1/2 year old daughter has been peeing on the floor.    She pulls down her pants, sits on the floor an pees.    She does this all over the house.    I've asked her why she does it and I've gotten the following responses.    "" I didn't want to miss my show""    ""I didn't want to stop playing"" ""I just can't take it"".    Throughout the day I constantly ask her if she has to use the bathroom.    She has no problem using the bathroom to pass bowel movements and when we are out she always tells me when she needs to use the bathroom.    She usually only pees on the floor during the day when her father is at work.    When I ask her if she has peed on the floor she gets really embarrassed and asks me ""If I'm going to be mad"". When I tell her she's going to start wearing a diaper and make her put one on she cries and begs to take it off.    She says she's not a baby and always promises to stop doing it.    She gets really upset when we tell her she's going to have to wear a diaper like a baby.    I am 9 months pregnant and she knows she has a baby brother on the way (not sure if that could be the cause)."

DISE	Possible Chlamydia?	I am a 23 year old male and recently (about 4 weeks ago) I had the judgment lapse while on a business trip in Europe and I decided to have protected sex with a woman I met in Geneva. So long story short; after two weeks I started to have the following symptoms:Ã¢ € ¢Pain (burning sensation) when urinatingÃ¢ € ¢Cloudy and foul smelling urineÃ¢ € ¢The skin on the tip of my penis directly under my urethra was red but that shortly subsided within the    second day of all of this happeningÃ¢ € ¢White fluid that I noticed in my boxer-briefs after the first day of this occurring and that was the only time it occurredÃ¢ € ¢An itch that started at the opening of my urethra, which was present for a few days but has now made its way down my urethra and feels as if is half way down my penis. It seems to be intermittent but it is definitely noticeable.Ã¢ € ¢The burning sensation during urination has dissipated, however the itch is still present and its certainly noticeable.At this point I am entirely certain that I have caught something and I have a doctorÃ¢ € ™s appointment scheduled with my doctor when I get back from this current business trip, which is early next week. However, from what I have read online, I would suggest that I have contacted Chlamydia. I would like to know if these symptoms are concurrent with any other possible STDÃ¢ € ™s or infections.Your feedback is very much appreciated.Thank you,	burning sensation during urination|burning sensation|symptoms|Chlamydia|urethra|penis|back|fluid

Now the last time I had my period was about 3 1/2 yrs ago.My husband and I would like to do try In Vitro soon, but I'm not sure if I can because I only have my uterus and no period.

Hey Guys,So here is the situation...For probably a year and a half now a brightish, flickering shimmering disk appears in more or less exactly the spot in my vision where the blind spot would naturally be. It's appearance is more or less constant and unchanging. Immediately after closing my eye, I white spot in my vision, which quickly fades away.The onset of this visual change was accompanied by a dull throbbing pain in my eye, that comes and goes...its not particularly painful, but definitely noticeable...oh, and sometimes it feels like more of a burning sensation.It has been, as for as I can tell, completely unchanged since it began, but I would like to know what it is, what it could be related to...I've had an MRI, which came back negative for the tell-tale lesions of MS, visual field, the standard battery, but they all came back normalI'd appreciate any thoughts?-S	burning sensation|throbbing pain|painful|flickering|back|eye

DISE	Long term effects of Effexor/Venlafaxine?	Has anyone experienced any long term effects since stopping the Effexor (Venlafaxine)?     I had to go off this cold turkey last December (2010) because the doctor thought I was having an allergic reaction, after having a lump feeling when I swallowed.    As of today (10/19/11)    I am still having the same feeling.    Been to a few ENT's & Gastro doc who all think it is acid related.    This feeling in my throat started while I was on the Venlafaxine.    It doesn't hurt, it just feels like when your tonsils are swollen.    Also the past few weeks I have been feeling dizzy, getting headaches often, nauseous, neck & joint pains, problems with simple words, extreme anxiety.    So I was just wondering if anyone has had any long term effects after going off these meds?    (or if these are just a whole new set of issues??)    Being the withdraw symptoms from going off these med's were so awful to go through...who knows what/if any long term effects.    It was so strange while on the Venlafaxine, if I forgot to take my dose at 8am, by noon I felt sick as a dog.    To some of you going through the withdraw, I was in bed for about 4 days straight after stopping cold turkey.    I felt awful, couldn't get out of bed.    If I could of gotten up, I would of went to the hospital!    I can not believe how this medication effects your body.    (brain zaps, vomiting, body aches, crying...just to name a few of many symptoms)    After 4 days, I was able to get out of bed & go for a short car ride, but then back home to lay down.    With every day after I began to feel a little bit better.    (This was a week before Christmas!!!    But I was able to pull off Christmas dinner for 30-with my wonderful husbands help of course the following week)     So there is light at the end of the tunnel.    I would say after about 4 weeks, the brain zaps, nausea & dizziness began to subside and I was starting to feel a bit normal again!     (although for the previous 2-3 weeks I was able to function, but was about a full month before the brain zaps finally stopped)    And what a bizarre feeling those brain zap-electric shock feelings were!!!    While researching withdraw symptoms, I was shocked & both comforted to find that so many others had been though this very same thing (at some point, you begin to think your going bonkers!!!!).    After reading many posts, It seems that weeing off the Effexor just seems to prolong the inevitable withdraw symptoms.    And so sad to read that many many people have been on this medication for years & years because they can't deal with the withdraw symptoms.    My doctor did offer me other med's to help with the awful withdraw symptoms, but I really wanted to be free of taking any med's and was hoping that the worst of the symptoms were over & I was willing to endure the pain to get this poison completely out of my system.    I am glad that I declined the additional med's because like I mentioned that by day 4, I was able to get out of bed and feel somewhat human again (taking it easy though) & from that day on I started to feel a little better every day.    (and I felt like 4 days of torture was far better than being stuck on this medication for years to come, or possibly forever like some others who have reached out to share their stories)	feeling dizzy|headaches|dizziness|nauseous|symptoms|nausea|pains|aches|pain|cold turkey|tonsils|brain|body|Gastro|throat|back|ENT|light|previous 2
GOAL	AcriSof Toric Implant 2.25 Post Op correction	I had the above implant operation on June 4 - model SN6AT4    19.0D 2.25CYL.    Prior to surgery I had near 20/20 dull but unaided vision in the eye, and wore reading glasses with a -O.25CYL correction in them.7 days after the Op I have severe ghosting at all distances in this eye, and both my Optometrist and Surgeon think that there will be little long term improvement in unaided vision. I have had an exceptional result in my right eye, such that unaided binocular distance vision is reasonable, but no where near as good as pre-op.Yesterday my surgeon measured the astigmatism in the left eye as slightly above 1.5 diopters, with the implant lens being 2 degrees out of alignment.    He is extremely resistant to exchanging or moving the lens placement.    He says that should I prefer not to wear distance glasses (the whole point of the op in the first place) then he can have a custom lens made to place over the top of the over-correcting Toric.My questions are a) should I spend the money on a second surgical opinion re my options and b) how successful is this custom made lens he refers to?	implant lens|operation|implant|severe|alignment|astigmatism|lens|right eye|left eye|eye

SOCL	Obsessed?	"For the last 9 years I was convinced I was in love with a woman I met in High School. She ignored my advances up until a few months ago when I took a last-ditch shot via a social networking site. She turned me down, and informed me that she and her boyfriend had just gotten back together, even though they had broken up several times in the past. After feeling rejected by her for so long, I exploded and told her her boyfriend was gay (he probably is) and that he would hurt her. I barely know her or her boyfriend.She called me obsessive, and said that I was ""stalking"" her. I don't feel that the stalking accusation is fair, but I'm pretty sure obsessive is right on the nose. I don't know why it's like this with her. She wants nothing to do with me, and that only attracts me to her further. I am afraid I'm going to become one of those crazy stalkers, because I find myself thinking insane thoughts like ""if she just really got to know me, she'd be in love with me."" I recognize that this behavior is unhealthy and I want to stop, but I seem to be losing control over it.I don't even want to have these feelings for her, yet I can't seem to overcome them."	back|said|nose|right

The fever got as high as 102+ but they let me go home 4/29 as planned.    I have been getting fevers daily and they are controlled with the motrin, but is this normal?

They straight cath'd me once and ended up putting the catheter back in for about another 12 hours.    I slowly began to pee on my own, but it is still really uncomfortable both in my abdomen and actually peeing (unless my bladder is really full then its just uncomfortable in my abdomen).I am so miserable, I don't know what to do.

FAML	Kindergarten blues	My son just turned 6 in December, and is currently in Kindergarten. According to his Teacher he his having behavior problems at school. She is constantly sending notes home telling of his actions at school that day. For example some of these notes are... Today in class he tossed his coloring box in the air, but instead of catching it he dropped it onto the floor & it spilled everywhere; Today on the playgroung he kicked the rubber pieces & one hit a little girl on the leg; while coming in from lunch he slid on the rug in class like it was first base, today when asked by an adult to move down a seat at lunch he gave her a dirty look and put his head down on the table, when she asked him a second time he then moved but gave her a disrespectful look, a reffeal will be written. My question is just are these normal behaviors for a 6 year old kindergarten boy or should he already be completely aware of what to do in these situation? What is developmentally normal behavior wise at this age?	catching|Today|head|leg|actions

DISE	I had a consult today with Hepatologist at CPMC	I had a consult today with a good Hepatologist at CPMC, Gish's office in SF.    It feels like I talked to the real thing, finally!    Having had to fend for myself medically, I am ready to follow the a pied piper to SVR.    My 10 week PCR showed ambiguous results of UND and > 75<200, but was unclear.    PCR at 20 weeks was clearly UND at <75IU/ml.    My GI admitted to me that I know more than he does about HCV and I RAN to the phone for another opinion....Interestingly, Dr. F., found my old bx, (stage 1, grade 2) and new Ultrasound disturbing as to stage and grade, as he didn't think they were as good as it looked.    Didn't have much to say about the Fibroscan, except that he thinks it's a good tool.    He thinks my stage could be mixed.    He noticed my red palms and stiff liver and didn't consider the good news of fibroscan and bx as grerat news, but rather as questionable.    When I showed him the discrepancies in the 10 and 20 week PCR's he was further unconvinced that I was UND at 10 weeks.    He thought it would be best to figure it wasn't UND.    I agree.    Therefore, he suggests that I treat for 60 weeks, rather than 48 and will facilitatate this happening.    Factored into this was the fact of my ultrasounds, red palms (which no one noticed until now), age (55), high VL (10 mil copies), genotype 1a....Why not be safer than sorry?    He also said he would consider me being likely to SVR at 90% possibly, no guarantees of course.    He gave me a TMA down to <5 today, and will consider that to be the sign that I am good to go....Wouldn't 60 weeks be better than relapse?Questions to come....	ultrasounds|Fibroscan|Ultrasound|fibroscan|liver|said

FAML	uncontrollable fear in my 8 year old son	My 8 year old son suffers with extreme irrational fear. The topics of fear change about every three months. I first noticed his problem when he was 5 years old and he developed a fear of the police. He would cry uncontrollably when ever he heard a siren or saw a police man in tho street. He thought that they was coming for him. He wouldn't listen to any reasoning. His fears since then have changed so often and when a new fear comes along his last one disappears. He has since feared travelling anywhere regardless of the distance in case we got lost, ran out of petrol or broke down. I have had to physically force him into the car at times because he would resist that much. His most recent fear is swimming although he is an accomplished swimmer he Will not even get into the pool. He just clams up and cries and doesn't listen to anything and if you pursue it he will get physical. When he is in this mind set its like he has no control over his actions. He will cry scream kick punch anything but listen to reason. Please help	siren|actions

FAML	8 Yr. old w/ behavioral issues	My only child is a 8yr. old boy. I'm a single mother and my son only visits with his father about 2 days out of the month. He generally obeys my orders at home and listens when I speak to him. However, he just began the third grade on August 25th, and I've already had to attend 2 parent/teacher conferences related to his behavior, and now his grades are also being affected. He has three teachers, and they all say he's very bright, but he can't seem to sit still or concentrate. They say when he's prompted to do independant work he simply sits there and stares. There's absolutely no complaints about him being disrespectful; actually, they say he's one of the most respectful kids in their classes. And, when they give him instructions, ie: go back to your seat, he follows them, but then two minutes later, he's back to whatever he was doing. I feel helpless and frustrated. I reward him when he does well, and I take away privileges, ie: no tv, to wii, when he does'nt do so well. The counselor placed him on a behavior chart and also promised him prizes if he did well, but that doesn't seem to be helping either. His teachers say he doesn't seem to care that I'm gonna see that chart. The teachers and I have both filled out some behavioral forms which I'm supposed to take to his pediatrician to see if he has ADD, ADHD, or something along those lines, but I'm a little hesitant about having him diagnosed. Any suggestions????	diagnosed|stares|back|minutes

It sickens me to find out that while I take care of the baby and try to recuperate, he's clicking on things like ""teen **** gets ****** hard"", and buying magazines with naked blonds sucking dicks. He admited having a problem a year ago, but I didn't understand the severity of it until a few month ago. I was hoping we could re-discover sex together, *** like never before since it's been so long but no...I understand he even left me at the hospital for a few hours during my stay there, to go and jerk off!!!!I wish it didn't bother me, that the whole ""unconditonal love"" thing would help in this..but it doesn't. Every time he touches me lately I feel sick. It took me a while to want to sleep with him, especially after I found out about his problem. What's the use of us having sex? I masturbate too granted, but I don't need porn, I think of him! That's what's pathetic! I don't want to be intimate with him anymore. I've felt like this many times, but now especially NOW, I just can't. where will our relationship go???I even went down on him, as I was aching everywhere, thinking ""hey he deserves it!"", and the next thing I know he didn't need it after all.He is defensive about it and secretive.

DISE	my dad fell down flight of stairs	My 70 year old father took a fall down a flight of stairs 2 days ago.    He was ruched to the ER where they stapled the 4 inch gash on the top left of his head.    He also has a small non displaced fracture of his orbital bone on the left, a couple broken ribs on the left, a bruised left hand, and a small skull fracture on the left temporal area.    He has a small bleed in the epidural space.    They did an MRI this morning, but I do not know the results yet.    He was treated overnight for tremors, but otherwise seems to be doing well.    He has a family history (his mother) of Alzheimer's and (his uncle) had Parkinson's.    I wanted to know what the odds are that this could cause one of those to appear.    His mother's Alzheimer's progressed pretty fast after a fall.    I believe we have already begun to see some signs of it before his accident, but my father is an alcoholic and it is hard to distinguish between the drinking and the disease.    I also believe he may be hiding some issues from his doctors because he wants nothing to do with reading the newspaper which he always does.    I think his sight is bothering him, but he really wants to go home so he isn't owning up to it.    The doctor's at the hospital don't want to say much to either me or my mom.    They only have mentioned to my mom about an intervention.    My dad has drank since I was small and I am 32.     I have 3 siblings all who agree with the fact that he wouldn't take well to an intervention.    My dad would simply refuse to speak to us anymore.    He only really talks to a couple of us anyways.    Any useful information would be greatly appreciated.	orbital bone|head|ribs|hand|Alzheimer|and disease|Parkinson's|epidural|stapled|tremors|temporal

FAML	What is Normal Communication?	"My stepdaughter, age 4, frequently does not want to talk to her biological father, who lives out of state.    The father continually insists that he is to have COURT ORDERED Daily ""Open Communication"" with his daughter.    The divorce order does state ""Open Communication"" during the days when the child is not with the other parent.    The father calls my wifes cell phone everyday sometimes 2 to 3 times to supposedly talk to his daughter.    He will even call a second time the same day even after talking to his daughter.    My wife does not talk to her ex-husband, bitter divorce, but answers her phone so the father may talk to his daughter.    My step-daughter, age 4, does not want to talk every single day to her father; she many times is either eating dinner, playing with dolls, watching a movie, playing with her step-brothers.    She does talk to her father for 5-10 minutes about 2-3 times/week.    The biological father is taking my wife to court alleging that she is in ""Contempt"" by not allowing communication with his daughter, which is obviously false.

DISE	Surgery Outcome	"Hi all,    I've also posted this on other relevant forums but this is the main forum I've been addressing my questions to before surgery so thought I'd let you know what happened.Had surgery over a week ago - so the GOOD news is there is no cancer in there.    What a relief that was.The **** news is that I have to have a hysterectomy which means definitely no kids.    I kinda thought maybe I would have one kid in the next couple of years so I have to come to terms with that.I was in hospital 4 nights instead of one as it was quite complex.    There was endometriosis all over the left ovary and the the adhesions from it had caused the ovary to attach to the bowel wall, the fallopian tubes and the pelvic wall so she had to take the left ovary out and remove all that endo from the other organs.     The ovary was very enlarged and the cyst was still on it and was filled with blood as it was an endometrioma (cyst from endometriosis).I lost a lot of blood post-op and was collapsing when I went to stand up.    I blacked out twice and once ended up on the bathroom floor and woke up with a pillow under my head and sheets over me!    All I recall was pressing the button for the nurse to come in as I was feeling faint on the loo.    She said she came and I stood up and then put my head on the wall and went down.    She had to get an orderly to help get me back to bed.     The other time I was sitting on the toilet and the nurse was right there and I came to looking at her close up thinking ""Who the hell are you and where am I?""    She said I blacked out for 2 minutes with my eyes open! The drain was taking up a lot of blood, more than it should have and I was also bleeding out of the drain as my pjs and sheets were soaked about 4 times with blood.    My doctor said I would have to go    back to surgery as she thought a blood vessel had reopened but thank God it settled and I didn't have to but it left me very anaemic and weak.    She didn't want to do a transfusion though so it just took a few days to build up my blood loss.Apparently the right ovary is as bad as the left and the uterus has a huge fibroid pushing on the bowel.    The fibroid is INSIDE the uterus which means she can't take it out without taking out the uterus.    The fibroid has added about 1/3 of the size to the uterus yet again. So all in all I'm still kinda trying to make some sense of all this and feeling a bit sorry for myself.    I have 3 weeks off work.     I have no idea how the surgeon didn't rupture the bowel as she showed me photos of how the endo had entangled itself all over the bowel like a vine, yet she managed to get it off without damaging the bowel.    I do have really bad cramps in that area though which she said is normal as the bowel is been aggravated and traumatised.TAKE care..."	fallopian tubes|pelvic wall|right ovary|left ovary|organs|vessel|ovary|bowel|head|eyes|lot|endometriosis|uterus|cyst|said|endometriosis).I|sense|feeling faint|cramps|weak|transfusion|soaked|drain|2 minutes|enlarged|back|right

SOCL	Romney set to assail Obama for welfare changes	"(CNN) - Changes to welfare pushed by President Barack Obama's administration are providing his Republican challenger Mitt Romney with material for a new round of attacks, including a television ad released Tuesday.The changes, which would allow states greater flexibility in administering their welfare-to-work programs, came in a directive issued by the Department of Health and Human Services in mid-July. At the time, some Republicans claimed the new rules amounted to a ""gutting"" of work requirements for welfare recipients, which were a central element of the bipartisan welfare reform law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996.Ã¢ € “ Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTickerÃ¢ € “ Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November.In Tuesday's ad from the Romney campaign, an announcer points to Clinton's achievement, and claims Obama's directive would ""gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements.""""Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check,"" the announcer continues. ""And welfare to work goes back to being plain old welfare.""Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said the welfare ad was one piece in a larger push to highlight the Obama administration's changes to ways states administer welfare.""Middle-class Americans are working harder and harder to make ends meet,"" Saul wrote. ""Under President Obama, they have fewer jobs and less take-home pay. And now, President Obama wants to take their hard-earned tax dollars and give it to welfare recipients without work requirements.""Romney, she wrote, ""would restore the work requirement in the welfare law so that recipients know the dignity of work instead of the dependency of a handout.""The Obama administration directive, issued July 12, allows individual states to experiment with changes to their welfare-to-work programs, which are federally funded. The intent, according to the directive, is to ""challenge states to engage in a new round of innovation that seeks to find more effective mechanisms for helping families succeed in employment.""The welfare-to-work program affected by the directive Ã¢ € “ the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Ã¢ € “ was created by the welfare reform law signed by Clinton in 1996. That measure was considered a win for conservatives, who long pushed for a provision that required work training for Americans receiving government assistance.The Obama administration argues the potential changes would help people move quickly from welfare rolls to paying jobs by reducing burdensome requirements, including excessive paperwork. Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, said Tuesday that any suggestion Obama was ""gutting"" welfare-to-work programs was false.""Let me say that this advertisement is categorically false and it is blatantly dishonest,"" Carney said. ""This administration's policy will strengthen the program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways.""He called Republican criticism of the changes ""outrageous,"" pointing to past support from Republican governors Ã¢ € “ including Romney Ã¢ € “ for waivers to the federal requirements.""The ad is particularly outrageous as Governor Romney himself with 28 other Republican governors supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever. Those are not standards the president supports,"" Carney said.In 2005, Romney signed a letter along with 29 other state governors to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, calling for greater state flexibility in managing their TANF programs.""Increased waiver authority, allowable work activities, availability of partial work credit and the ability to coordinate state programs are all important aspects of moving recipients from welfare to work,"" the letter read.In a memo Tuesday, Romney's campaign Policy Director Lanhee Chen wrote that Romney has remained consistent in supporting work requirements for welfare recipients.""Because Massachusetts had implemented reforms of its own shortly before the federal reforms of 1996, it was actually exempt from many of the federal requirements when Romney took office as governor,"" Chen wrote. ""But nevertheless, facing an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature in one of the most liberal states in the country, Romney vetoed efforts to weaken work requirements and he pressed repeatedly to instead strengthen them and bring them in line with federal standards.""Obama's re-election campaign responded to the ad in a statement Tuesday, accusing Romney of ""not telling the truth.""""The truth is that the President is giving states additional flexibility only if they move more people from welfare to work Ã¢ € “ not fewer. As Governor, Romney asked for even greater flexibility to waive the central part of the law by letting people receive benefits for an indefinite period and as HHS has said, his waiver request wouldn't be approved today because it weakened the law too much. By falsely attacking a policy that both he and his Republican allies have supported for years, Romney is once again flip flopping on a position he took in Massachusetts, and demonstrating that he lacks the core strength and principles the nation needs in a President,"" Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a statement.http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/07/romney-set-to-assail-obama-for-welfare-changes/?hpt=hp_bn3"	telling truth|administration|administering|Changes|Bill|gut|dropping|back|said|aspects|programs
PREG	Ovulating on day 8-10...	Have any of you ovulated WAY early before?    I feel like I'm ovulating because of CM and slight cramping but I just ended AF a few days ago so I think it's too early.    I did use an OPK last night which had a slight line but not a surge and then again this am with a barely noticeable line.    So based off of that I don't think I'm Oing...but you never know.    I don't want to keep POAS and wasting them if you don't think this is a possibility to ovulate so early.For crying out loud, I have been POAS too much!    My 2 1/2 DS thinks he should try too.    He grabbed a wrapped OPK this am and said he had to go potty!    I'm probably confusing the poor kid!	cramping|potty|wasting|said

PREG	Pray for my son	As some of you know, my son was born with Spina bifida and hydrocephalus. He has a shunt in to drain the fluid from his brain. Today we took him in to get a CT because he isn't acting right, and it turns out that the shunt has malfunctioned....the fluid is building back into his brain and if this isn't taken care of there will be non reversable brain damage. They are going to have to go back in there and replace the shunt. It's a pretty easy surgery, but still brain surgery. It's friday and I can't get ahold of this neuro-surgen, so I had to call the hospital and am waiting for them to call me back and let me know what the next step will be. What happend last time is they had us go strait to the hospital for emergancy surgery.So please pray for Nathan and that everything will be ok....that he makes it through the surgery with no complications and there has been no brain damage yet.	brain surgery|drain|fluid|brain|Today|back|right

SOCL	How Goldman Sachs Starved Millions and Got Away With It	"While Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to resolve a civil fraud lawsuit filed by the SEC, Goldman has not been held accountable for many of its other questionable investment practices. A new article in HarperÃ¢ € ™s Magazine examines the role Goldman played in the food crisis of 2008 when the ranks of the worldÃ¢ € ™s hungry increased by 250 million. We speak to HarperÃ¢ € ™s contributing editor Frederick Kaufman.AMY GOODMAN: We continue with Goldman Sachs.JUAN GONZALEZ: Well, while Goldman Sachs agreed Thursday to pay $550 million to resolve a civil fraud lawsuit filed by the SEC, Goldman has not been held accountable for many of its other questionable investment practices. A new article in HarperÃ¢ € ™s Magazine examines the role Goldman played in the food crisis of 2008, when the ranks of the worldÃ¢ € ™s hungry increased by 250 million. The article is titled ""The Food Bubble: How Wall Street Starved Millions and Got Away With It.""AMY GOODMAN: The author of the article, Frederick Kaufman, joins us now. HeÃ¢ € ™s a contributing editor at HarperÃ¢ € ™s Magazine.Well, explain. WeÃ¢ € ™re talking about Goldman Sachs today, thisÃ¢ € ”they call it a landmark settlement, but they made more after-hours in trading last night than they will have to pay. So letÃ¢ € ™s look at Goldman Sachs and its record overall.FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah, this is reallyÃ¢ € ”itÃ¢ € ™s really outrageous. And on a certain level, this reform bill is really a sham, because it does not cover, in any way, shape or form, what Goldman SachsÃ¢ € ”and really, letÃ¢ € ™s be honest here, it wasnÃ¢ € ™t just Goldman; it was Goldman, and it was Bear, and it was AIG, and it was Lehman, it was Deutsche, it was all across the board, JPMorgan ChaseÃ¢ € ”what these banks were able to do in commodity markets, really which reached its peak from 2005 to 2008, in what is now known as the food bubble. And as Juan points out, this is unconscionable what happened, in the sense that their speculation and their restructuring of these commodity markets pushed 250 million new people into food insecurity and starving, and brought the world total up to over a billion people. This is the most abysmal total in the history of the world.JUAN GONZALEZ: Now, what were these commodities markets like before the Wall Street firms got involved? And you have a haunting picture, especially of the Minneapolis Exchange, what it was before, what it was like. Could you talk about how things operated and then what Goldman Sachs did precisely?FREDERICK KAUFMAN: The wheat markets, in particular, in this country are the outcome of a process of development of over 150 years. And that is why, from about 1903 to 2003, the real price of wheat in this country has gone down. And this was one of the great reasons for AmericaÃ¢ € ™s great twentieth century, the fact that we had cheap food, we had cheap bread. And Goldman, in 1991, came up with a new idea and a new product, which, as I said before, completely restructured this market and completely threw it out of whack.But before we go there, we just have to maybe review for a second a little bit about how these markets worked and what kept that wheat price stabilized. And Juan, you mentioned the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, this kind of obscure syndicate in the Midwest, which is where the price of this particular kind of wheat, hard red spring wheat, which is the most widely traded wheat in the world, and itÃ¢ € ™s the most widely exported wheat from the American continentÃ¢ € ”we kind of set the world price on this wheat. This is where it happens. WhatÃ¢ € ™s the history of that price being stabilized is you have, traditionally, in the wheat futures market, two kinds of players: one of the farmers and the millers and the warehousemenÃ¢ € ”right? And this, of course, includes players like DominoÃ¢ € ™s Pizza and Sara Lee and General Mills, very large business, capitalist stakes are in this wheat market, right? And they are called bona fide hedgers, because theyÃ¢ € ™re actually buying and selling real wheat. As the price fluctuates in the futures markets, you also traditionally have speculators in this market, people who donÃ¢ € ™t want wheat, who wouldnÃ¢ € ™t have any place to put it if they bought it, but theyÃ¢ € ™re making money off buy orders and sell orders, as the price fluctuates each day, and hopefully theyÃ¢ € ™re bringing in some money for themselves every day. ThatÃ¢ € ™s the idea.Now, the key here is that both the bona fide hedgers and the speculators, every time they buy, theyÃ¢ € ™re also selling, and every time they sell, they eventually buy. So their positions are cleared off at the end of the day, OK? Goldman, we have to understand, and a lot of these banks, are not interested in the particular structure of any of these markets. I think itÃ¢ € ™s a lot of mistake people make when they think about how these bankers are working. We think that theyÃ¢ € ™re actually interested in the markets. We think that theyÃ¢ € ™reÃ¢ € ”no. What theyÃ¢ € ™re after are very large pools of cash for themselves. TheyÃ¢ € ™re after accumulating huge pools of money that they can do with whatever they like on a day-to-day basis. Right? And so, Goldman, in 1991, came up with this idea of the commodity index fund, which really was a way for them to accumulate huge piles of cash for themselves. It wasnÃ¢ € ™t really about the markets, anyway. The market was just an excuse. And so, the fact that they threw these wheat markets out of whack didnÃ¢ € ™t really matter to them.How did this work? Instead of a buy-and-sell order, like everybody does in these markets, they just started buying. ItÃ¢ € ™s called ""going long."" They started going long on wheat futures. OK? And every time one of these contracts came due, they would do something called ""rolling it over"" into the next contract. So they would take all those buy promises they had made and say, ""OK, we stillÃ¢ € ”weÃ¢ € ™re just going toÃ¢ € ”weÃ¢ € ™ll buy more later. And plus weÃ¢ € ™re going to buy more now."" And they kept on buying and buying and buying and buying and accumulating this unprecedented, this historically unprecedented pile of long-only wheat futures. And this accumulation created a very odd phenomenon in the market. ItÃ¢ € ™s called a ""demand shock."" Usually prices go up because supply is low, right? ThatÃ¢ € ™s the idea. ThereÃ¢ € ™s not a lot of supply, so the price goes up. In this case, Goldman and the other banks had introduced this completely unnatural and artificial demand to buy wheat, and that then set the price up. Now, a lot of people are saying, ""Oh, it was biofuel production. It was drought in Australia. It was floods in Kazakhstan."" Let me tell you, hard red wheat generally trades between $3 and $6 per sixty-pound bushel. It went up to $12, then $15, then $18. Then it broke $20. And on February 25th, 2008, hard red spring futures settled at $25 per bushel. This is completely beyond the pale, particularly at aÃ¢ € ”JUAN GONZALEZ: Almost ten times its historic price.FREDERICK KAUFMAN: Yeah. It was just completely out of control. And, of course, the irony here is that in 2008, it was the greatest wheat-producing year in world history. The world produced more wheat in 2008 than ever before."	hungry|Mills|demand|overall|Sachs|piles|said|pile|sense|lot|players|particular structure|right|order

FAML	11 year old on zoloft - headaches?	My son has been on zoloft for just over two months. He started on 25 mg. His dose was recently increased to 50 mg. Within 2 weeks of the increase, he has had a headache, mainly on the right side of his head at the temple. He had also been on other medications for a sinus infection and bronchitis (pulmicort, nasonex and xopenex + an antibiotic). He is now off of most of those meds (except the antibiotic), so I guess I can conclude that those meds were not the source of his headache. It has been hard for me to determine where the headache is coming from, but now I am focused on the zoloft - it is the one consistent med he is still on. We have already seen an allergist (still having allergy tests), an ENT and a trip to the ER. In the ER we had a second cat scan done (The first cat scan was a month before which helped us to determine that he had a sinus infection, which have become chronic) The second cat scan showed a huge improvement in his sinuses, so we know that he is responding to the antibiotics. We have also had an eye test and have an appointment for the dentist - maybe he is having referred pain from his teeth?? He has had this headache for over 2 weeks - and less that 2 weeks before that his zoloft dose increased to 50mg. We are going to his psychiatrist in a few days to discuss, but in the meantime, my son is in some pain. When he stands up from sitting or sits up from lying down his head throbs for a few seconds and then stops, but the dull headache remains. Any advice/ experience would be MOST welcome!Thanks - Anne	allergy tests|scan|referred pain|pain|bronchitis|infection|temple|ENT|head|eye|+ antibiotic|antibiotics|antibiotic|right

FAML	Perfect 5 year old suddenly CRAZY!	My 5 year old son (will be six in 2 months) has always been a delightful child.    For the past 5 years, I've told him if all kids were like him, I'd have 100 kids.    He's just a joy, or was until about 6 weeks ago.    For the past 6 weeks, a couple times a week, he's been having complete and total breakdowns - temper tantrums that go for hours and I don't know what to do.    I've tried everything - trying to hold him and soothe him, leaving him in his room, reasoning with him, punishing him by taking things away, etc... NOTHING WORKS, except perhaps ignoring him, just letting him go crazy but even that can last an hour or two.    That said, it's not always possible to just let him go crazy as there are places we need to be or we're in public.    I don't know what is causing my perfect child to suddenly be so out of control.    It's about all different kinds of things too - nothing particular, except maybe consistently wanting his own way.Here's my biggest problem - he's refusing to go to school, and so out of control that it's dangerous to even try to take him there.    Once he's there, he calms down pretty quickly and has a great day.    He tried to open the car door when it was moving, after unbuckling himself so he's a danger to himself when tantrumming.    Once we get there, he continues to be out of control - but once we get him in the class and I run out, he stops crying and screaming within about 10 minutes and has a GREAT day at school.    He comes home and is happy, and tells us about is good day at school.    He's in Kindergarten but went to this same school last year, full day for Pre-K - and never got in trouble once so I don't think it's the teacher or school.I don't know what to do!    I just don't seem to have the skills to deal with him and am at my wit's end.    I love him more than anything but I don't know what to do.    I want to help him through this but nothing seems to work.    HELP!	said|unbuckling|minutes

Yesterday I went to see my doctor after having blood in my urine (noticed when I wiped) and after a urine sample was taken my doctor told me that I have a UTI (doctor said I had pus and blood in my urine) and gave me a script for antibiotics to take for 7 days. This morning I have been feeling really nauseas and when I went for a number 2, I noticed that my stool was black and tarry looking like.I have no idea why as I haven't eaten anything that could turn it into black and was wondering whether I should go back to my doctor and whether the black stool is anything to worry about? I'm taking prenatal vitamins and have been taking them for 2 months and haven't noticed my stool being black before, so unsure whether this could be the cause?Thank you.	nauseas|said|UTI|back|antibiotics
DISE	swollen legs, not usual causes	I'm at witts end.    Had this for years intermittantly, but persistant for several weeks this time.    My feet and legs so full of fluid, I can only sit at the computer for 2 hours before I have to quit, and so earning almost NO income.In the past, been tested for heart disease, circulatory problems of legs, salt balance, etc. None of the usual causes.    The following does not help or alter the situation:    no salt in diet, more salt, vitamin or mineral supplements, more exercise, less exercise, elevating limbs (temporary relief). Blood panels show nothing.I honestly think it's a bowel obstruction, but I'm not constipated, just bloated.Since I can't earn enough to pay the rent, I don't have money for series of doctor visits and tests.    But if it doesn't quit, I can't earn a living.    CATCH 22!	bowel obstruction|Blood|disease|heart|limbs|feet|legs|CATCH|circulatory problems|and tests|fluid
DISE	Sweating after eating	When I asked my doctor, he curtly told me it was purely an idosyncratic sympton - unique to me and who knows why. I'm being treated for pancreatitis, and wondered if it were related to that. I saw that other people have written they have this symptom also. Other symptoms I have are swelling of feet & ankles,    metabolic syndrome, psoriasis, frequent yeast infections of outer skin, anemia, nodules on thyroid. Can anyone explain if any of these symptoms are related or the cause?	swelling of feet|Other symptoms|symptoms|symptom|nodules|ankles|anemia|metabolic syndrome

SOCL	Mississippi executes killer who fatally stabbed 4 of his nieces and nephews	"http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/06/12080446-mississippi-executes-killer-who-fatally-stabbed-4-of-his-nieces-and-nephews?liteHenry Curtis Jackson Jr. did not request a last meal and ate none of the standard dinner offered to him, corrections officials said.PARCHMAN, Miss. -- A Mississippi man convicted of killing his four young nieces and nephews in a 1990 stabbing rampage was executed Tuesday, despite pleas from his two sisters to spare the brother who killed their children.Henry ""Curtis"" Jackson Jr. was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m. CDT (7:13 p.m. ET) Tuesday after receiving an injection at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, officials said.Clad in a red prison jumpsuit as he lay strapped to a gurney, Jackson was asked if he wanted to make a statement.""No, I don't,"" he responded as family members sat somberly in a nearby witness room.Jackson's sister, Glenda Kuyoro, stifled a sob when she walked into the witness room earlier and saw her brother on the gurney. Jackson's eyes were closed when the witnesses arrived and he never looked in the direction of his family.Earlier, the 47-year-old inmate had spent the day receiving relatives, including one of the sisters whose two children were slain and who survived the stabbing attack. The slain children ranged from 2 to 5 and were killed as Jackson reportedly was trying to steal his mother's safe while she was away at church, court records showed.Jackson was the fourth person executed this year in the state and the 19th person executed in the nation.He did not request a last meal and ate none of the standard dinner offered to him, corrections officials said. He also declined a sedative ahead of the execution.Clemency deniedLate Tuesday afternoon, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant declined to stop the execution though he said he was ""deeply touched"" by requests for clemency from the sisters and his brother-in-law.In Mississippi, the governor has the sole authority to grant clemency and can also commute death sentences to life in prison.""There is no question that Mr. Jackson committed these heinous crimes, and there is no clear and convincing evidence that compels me to grant clemency,"" Bryant said.His statement added: ""One of these sisters was a stabbing victim, and both of the sisters are mothers of the murdered children. However, as governor, I have the duty to see that justice is carried out.""Corrections Commissioner Chris Epps said at a penitentiary briefing earlier Tuesday that the inmate acknowledged the crime and was talkative as he received relatives. Visitors included his sister Regina Jackson, who was stabbed five times and survived the attack that killed her two daughters and two nephews.Regina Jackson had met with the governor Monday and pleaded for her brother's life. She also wrote Bryant a letter last month saying she ""just can't take any more killing.""""As a mother who lost two babies, all I'm asking is that you not make me go through the killing of my brother,"" she wrote.'I forgave my brother'Kuyoro and her husband, Andrew, also had asked Bryant to spare the inmate in a letter dated May 15.""We are the victims in this case, and we are begging you not to let Curtis be killed. You can keep him in Parchman forever, but please don't put our family through this horrible execution,"" the Kuyoros had written earlier.After the execution Regina Jackson, who was one of the witnesses, said: ""I forgave my brother. I love my brother ... God says we got to forgive in order for Him to forgive us.""The attack took place Nov. 1, 1990, at Jackson's mother's home in the Delta region.The mother was at church that day, and Regina Jackson was there with her two daughters and four nieces and nephews. Her two daughters and two nephews were stabbed to death, records showed. Another niece was so severely injured that she was a paraplegic until her recent death.Jackson has said he doesn't remember stabbing the children, but there was testimony at his September 1991 trial that he cut the phone line before going in the house, then demanded money and began the attack, according to the court record.Regina Jackson testified at trial that she lapsed in and out of consciousness after being tied up and stabbed in the neck, but she could hear her brother dragging a safe down a hall. The noise awoke 5-year-old Dominique, one of her daughters.""Regina testified that Jackson called Dominique to him, told her that he loved her, stabbed her, and tossed her body to the floor,"" according to the court record. ""Jackson returned to Regina, stabbing her in the neck and twisting the knife, at which point she pretended to be dead until she heard him leave.""Jackson subsequently surrendered to police. He was convicted of four counts of capital murder at trial and sentenced to death."	injection|said|May|eyes|body|cut|trial|sole|order|CDT|sob

It's not just the 1 percent who'll feel the pinch.And take note, baby boomers: The Medicare you get won't be quite as generous as what your parents' generation enjoys. A higher deductible here, a new co-payment there, and the tweaks add up.With the future of Medicare on the line in the presidential election, The Associated Press asked the Obama campaign five questions about how his plans for seniors' health care would affect critical issues of costs and benefits. (The AP also sent Republican Mitt Romney a set of questions, and the responses are the subject of a companion report.)Unlike Romney, Obama is not calling for a major Medicare remake. Most of the president's cost-cutting ideas are incorporated in his health care law, and will phase in unless Romney wins and makes good on his pledge to repeal it. Other Obama proposals are drawn from government advisory groups or bipartisan commissions seeking consensus on how to reduce deficits.It doesn't mean they're pain-free. AARP gave a thumbs-down to this year's Obama budget, citing Medicare cost shifts.If Obama is re-elected and plunges into deficit negotiations with congressional Republicans, he will be pushed for greater Medicare savings, by cutting payments to service providers or squeezing more from recipients.""Neither one of (the candidates) is going to basically lay his cards on the table before the election,"" said former AARP CEO Bill Novelli, now at Georgetown University in Washington. ""Obama is going to have to raise the price of benefits, whether by hundreds or thousands, I don't know. Where else is the money going to come from, besides printing it?""Some Medicare questions for consumers to watch, along with answers from the Obama campaign and the views of several experts:Q: What new costs can seniors expect under Obama's plan for Medicare?A: You may need a CPA degree to understand the complicated details of changes proposed by the president.Broadly speaking, Obama would raise monthly premiums for retirees making $85,000 or more ($170,000 for married couples). He also would hit newly joining baby boomers with a series of fees.Currently only about 5 percent of beneficiaries pay higher, income-based monthly premiums for outpatient coverage under Medicare Part B and even fewer pay higher premiums for prescription drug coverage.Under Obama's proposal, a growing share of seniors would pay the higher premiums over time. He'd also bump up the premiums paid by higher-income beneficiaries by 15 percent.After about 20 years, the top 25 percent of Medicare recipients would be paying higher, income-based premiums.An analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that in 2017, a single retiree with income of $86,000 would pay $447 more in premiums for Medicare's outpatient and prescription drug coverage. A married couple with income of $175,000 would pay about $894 more in that year.As for the fees on newly joining baby boomers, they'd face a $25 increase in their annual outpatient deductible (initially for a few years only), some limits on the use of `Medigap' insurance to fill in gaps left by Medicare, and a new home health co-payment in certain cases.Think of these proposals as the president's opening bid in budget talks.Q: Hasn't Obama also hinted he might be willing to increase the eligibility age for Medicare?A: In budget negotiations with Republicans last year, Obama indicated a willingness to consider gradually raising the eligibility age to 67, from 65 now. Romney supports the idea. But the president has since walked it back."	cutting|thumbs|Bill|curb|West|said|pain|face|back|rights
FAML	10 year old confused	"My wife and I (48 and 46 respectively) have been married    21 years. Our only daughter, now 10, started using the internet for dress up games and toontown stuff about a year ago. We learned around three months ago that she had ""accidently"" accessed some porn sites about 9 months ago. Seems she saw some fairly racy materials. Next thing we know, she admitted touching herself - even to the point of feeling ""throbbing"", we we took as an orgasm. (I had no idea that was even possible at that age, but online I learned it is). Here recently, my wife and I can't even be alone in the same room without her thinking something is going on... truth is, we haven't had relations for years. (no particular reason... just haven't) The latest thing is that she now seems to read something sexual into almost everything now... last night my daughter and I fell asleep on the couch watching TV, she feels it necessary to tell my wife the next morning that ""nothing happened"". It's making us crazy and we don't know what to do. We are also afraid she will say something out of place and someone will get the wrong idea. For the record, our daughter has always slept in in our bedroom, but in her own bed alongside ours. I have recently (3-4 months) been sleeping in another room because of my snoring. As of tonight our daughter will sleep in her own room by herself whether she likes it or not. We know now that we probably should have insisted on that all along but were being too overprotective. Any comments and suggestions would be appreciated. We really don't know what to do."	snoring|touching
TRMT	my mirena	So I am curious about my iud.. My mother called me tonight and was talking to me about it, apparently she had seen something on the news saying that the iud could cause more problems than I had known about. Saying things like that I have that possibility that i could not get pregnant after the removal and it could cause diseases and failures in my body... I am concerned i am only 20 years old and have had the iud for about 2 years, so i am kind of concerned. I have gained wait which has been extremely depressing. I don't have periods and i don't have cramps. It is uncomfortable while having sex and i have had a couple of partners tell me they can feel it and it hurts them... i am just trying to decide if i wanna still keep it in or take it out... what should i do? any opinions?

Well now I don't think so....this month I know I caught my + OPK cause I got the smiley face.....so I put O 1-2 days later...and well last night I noticed a pink tinge of CM like AF is about to show....I'm praying maybe it's implantion but what if it is AF that means my luteal phase is only 11-12 days?    I haven't noticed more colored CM but I'm praying I don't and that AF holds off if she has to come......Here's the question that went with all the back ground....if I have a luteal defect what can I do about it??    Will my Dr. prescribe me something for it?    Does clomid help with that?	catching|face|back|luteal|right
DISE	CT Scan at 31 with atrophy???	Hi,I just recently had a CT scan for frequent headaches.    The report came back that I have atrophy near the vertex and that this is uncommon for my age (31) so they are sending me to have an MRI for further review.    After researching Cerebral atrophy I am very concerned something serious is wrong.    However, I don't have any other symptoms besides headaches which my doctor says is probably not related to the atrophy.    I just had my second child 6 months ago.    Does anyone know if child birth or weaning from the breast could be related to this?    Also I have never had a seizure or any other neurological problem.    Could this reading of the CT scan still mean I have nothing to worry about?Furthermore I had an MRI of the Brain when I was 20 but it came back normal.    Is this something that might have changed or can atrophy show up on a CT scan but look normal in an MRI?Thanks and I look forward to any insight.	frequent headaches|headaches|symptoms|seizure|neurological problem|Cerebral|breast|CT scan|vertex|back|Brain

FAML	Fear of Poo / Holding On / Refusing to Poo on Toilet or Potty	Not a question - just a comment:    My four year old son has been potty trained (for wee) for almost two years now, but REFUSES to do poo on the potty or toilet.    He has a long history of constipation, usually particularly bad if there are any changes in his life or tension in the household, or we simply loose sight of his water intake.    Twice he has been in hospital for pain and obstruction in his bowels.    First time, we had a very bad doctor who recommended suppositories and enemas.    These created HUGE poos, which caused incredible pain.    Our son developed his intense aversion to the toilet following these episodes.    The second hospital visit was more successful.    We were prescribed MOVICOL.    Its an over the counter pharmacy medication, which is NOT ABSORBED by the body so there is ZERO health risk for infants and children (though you should monitor there water intake and electrolytes in their system if you medicate too heavily or for too long).    It simply draws water from the body into the bowel, to soften even the most stubborn hard large or impacted poo.    He passed two - three weeks worth of poo completely pain free.    Now, we give him 1/3 to 1/2 a sachet of movicol every night in juice and it creates nice soft comfy poo ... we still have the behavioural issues associated with refusing to use the toilet.    We have consulted numerous experts, child psychologists, doctors, etc, and they all have a new plan, but basically it is within our son's control, not ours, and we are waiting for it to resolve, and trying to be patient, and trying to remind him that his poo is soft and the toilet does not make it hard, as he suspects.    But thankfully, we do not have the problem of it getting big and hard while he holds on.    For anyone who deals with a child holding on, and the pain that causes, you will know that it is more important to manage the consistency of the poo before the behavioural issues.    The colon stretches, and the poo starts to load up in there, so that it can really never pass, unless you soften it again.    It takes a few months to return to normal size.    Before that, the child cannot sense it coming until it is on the way out, at which time they seem to like to crouch down and soil instead of run to the toilet.    It is really really important to continue to medicate your child, with poo softeners, consistently, so that they have a good few months without a hard or big poo, before you start working on those behavioural issues like aversion to potty.    Solve the medical issue first, then turn to improving the grown up behaviours.    AND - the less you stress about it, the easier it will be for your child to overcome it without pressure.	stretches|sense|impacted|bowels|bowel|colon|body|remind|enemas|pain|potty

DISE	10cm growth in enlarged left kidney	I am a 55 year old American male professor in China, and during my routine employment physical, ultrasound imaging showed a 9.7cmx7.47cm mass was discovered in my left kidney, taking up half the space of my kidney. The kidney is enlarged. There are two growths in the right kidney. There is a language barrier, but the doctor indicates that this is serious, and requires surgery. He says it is non-cancerous at this time, but will be, if left untreated. I have not seen blood in my urine, though it does appear yellow, and a bit dark. My doctor in the USA gave me a physical about two months ago, and found nothing abnormal in lab results. For some reason, ultrasound is not routinely used in the States, though I feel it would be lifesaving for countless people were it to be. My condition would have been noticed and I would not be here in China if it had been detected.How dangerous is this, what will the surgery entail, and is it likely that my kidney will be removed?

GOAL	dilated left eye following cataract surgery	I had cataract surgery on my right eye; no problem.I had cataract surgery on my left eye; the lens was inserted improperly, or something.    The surgeon two days later replaced it with a diffenent type of lens, he said.    His follow up check the next day said it looked OK.    A week later in a follow up check up; the left eye is still dilated.    He wants me to continue adding the drops of the 3 solutions four times a day.    I'll see him in 6 weeks.	cataract surgery|left eye|lens|said|right
PREG	Help- Combine oral contraceptives?	Hi, I am 23 years old and anaemic and have had irregular    and sometimes painful periods every now and then, but have never skipped my monthly cycles. I usually bleed for around seven days. My last menstrual cycle started on 11th June and ended on 18th June 08. I am getting married in 3 weeks from now on 20th July and have never had sex before. I am anxious. My fiance insists on not using a condom on the nuptial night.    A friend recommended, Cipla's Janya. Is it safe to use? And if so, is it safe to consume during menstruation? because going by the seven day stipulation for a combined oral contraceptive to work, should I start the pills while I am menstruating ..from 13th July onwards? How am I to go about this.. ? As my Indian family will not tolerate me visting a gyneacologist before my marriage. Professional advice will be much much appreciated. Thank you.	painful periods|menstruation
FAML	Anxiety, a cause for diarrhea?	Hello,My 12 year-old battles diarrhea almost on a daily basis. We can't seem to track a consistant food cause from his diet the day before. It happens upon awakening and lasts until he can't go anymore.We've taken him to a Children's GE Dr. and had extensive testing via endoscopy, and colonoscopy, stool samples, etc. We've tried Rx such as Ammodium to no consistant success. Sometimes it does nothing.Also, he does take a daily prescription for ADD and nightly Prilosec for Asophogial reflux. (discovered via endoscopy) We also supplement with a daily OTC fiber tablet. The Prilosec seems to help the morning IBS because it is definitely worse and more frequent when the Prilosec is overlooked the noght before.We guess this problem may be related to the STRESS and ANXIETY of readying for the day. He is a CD student in special education with other anxiety related behaviors and is also physically impaired with a right side hypertonation. So the morning routine is nothing close to routine.We would appreciate any directional help on this.Thanks.	right|endoscopy

SOCL	Newly disabled boyfriend	So I am a 22 year old female, with a boyfriend of two years. I am a calm person who doesn't need to be the center of attention around others. Let me rewind some, my boyfriend is good to me, he pays the housing and doesn't cheat. We have other issues but I have one right now that I'm not sure I want to overlook. Ok, so when I was introduced to my boyfriend, I was informed that he had been in a terrible accident two years prior and almost died. Fortunately he didn't, however he did lose a limb, his right hand. About half way up the forearm. I went into this relationship understanding his disability and loving him regardless of his appearance. However, he is constantly living in the past. He is always bragging about all the material possessions he owned prior to his accident. At first I didn't mind, however two years later I am way tired of his need for attention. Everywhere we go, and everyone we run into he always tries to be the center of attention. He is embarrassing me. He complains when people cut him off from speaking, however I have pointed out to him he does it all the time. And then there is the sad story, some people actually have courage to ask what happened, and I can't tell you how many times I have heard him go into grave detail about his accident. Now I understand his need for acceptance but ssometimes it's too much for me. I have caught him a few times fabricating stories or exaggerating about the past. It's annoying two years later.    Fast forward to now, I have tried speaking to him without criticizing him about what he does. And he just gets really defensive. I'm not sure how to handle this anymore, obviously he needs counseling and I've suggested him going but nothing. I can deal with the physical part but the emotional baggage is overwhelming. I do love him, I just don't know if I can spend the rest of my life like This. Am I making a big deal? Should I look it over? Any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated.	counseling|forearm|limb|hand|cut|tired|right
GOAL	6 yo broken baby tooth gum line	My son somehow broke her premolar in half.    We went to his dentist the next day and they tried to pull the rest of it out, but couldn't get it all.    There is none left to see but he said there were roots and some left under the gum line.    We have an appt with an oral surgeon to remove the rest but I;m nervous about this.    They are going to sedate him for this.    Does this sound like a good plan?    the dentist whom I trust said that all of the baby tooth needs to come out to be sure the permanent doesn't have problems coming in.    I trust the dentist, but I don't know the surgeon and aftter having some bad experiences with my eldest child and dentist, I'm scared.

DISE	Cyst causing pain and lump in left testicle	"My 14 yr old has an appointment with a Urologist in the morning. Three months ago while seeking medical treatment on a broken bone in knee, the Orthopedic surgeion found pain in his thigh. While following the pain he found it traveled up inot his abdomen and to his scrotum. I took him back to the PCP that same day. She examined him and didn't physically find anything wrong with the testicles, but based on my son's knee jerking reactions she sent him for a sonogram. During the sonogram they found a mass that appears to be a cyst per the sonographer. Two days ago my son came to me because now he can fell a lump in the left testicle, which is where the pain is coming from. I guess I'm just fearful that they will have to do surgery and although I am looking for a solution for him, I am not looking forward to my ""baby"" going under the knife.Has anyone experienced this and if so, what was the outcome?"	left testicle|testicles|knee|treatment|sonogram|Orthopedic surgeion|abdomen|thigh|back|scrotum|cyst|PCP|pain

DISE	spinal tap only showed high IgG synthesis rate?	Hi all,I'm sneaking over here from the dyautonomia forum.    I actually had a spinal tap done for valley fever to rule it out to make sure it hasn't gone into my spine.    Of course that takes over a month to get results.    But in the mean time, nothing showed up on spinal tap except for a sythesis rate IgG of -5.5.    Although it's a minus, it reads in the reference range, High. Also no Olgioclonal Bands showed up.    Gluclose was normal as was all the other IgM, IgA, and album and IgG index.    I have been battling pain and headaches for a few years now. Can't do the MRI contrast due to severe reactions to all meds. So just the IgG synthesis rate is high.    I wonder if this could also mean spinal infection from valley fever?    Anyhow of course I can't get a hold of the doctor for days. Said they will call when the valley fever meningitis test comes back. Ugh.    Any ideas to ease my mind?Thank you so much for your time and have a healthy day,Tkimber	valley fever|infection|headaches|pain|spine|back|severe|contrast
GOAL	Topamax Blog	"I am a new Topamax user.    I have been reading posts and information from wherever I can find it and found a lot on this site.    I have started a blog for future users to read as they start the process.    I know that I had a lot of questions - for example - when do side effects start?    how soon does weight loss start if it is going to happen?    what is the relationship between dosage and weight loss?    what is the relationship between time on the medication and side effects?    can you lose weight even if you find that topamax doesn't act as an appetite suppressant?    does topamax affect your metabolism?    will i regain the weight if i go off topamax?So, these and many others are my questions - if you would like to offer any answers, please feel free to post them!    I will collect ideas and thoughts and add them to my blog.So - back to my blog - my blog is a daily DIARY about taking topamax.    It tells how much I took, what side effects I had and what, if any, weight loss I experience on a day to day basis.    So it helps to provide more detail that the typical, ""I lost 11 pounds in 2 months.""    Hmmm... how quickly did you lose that?    Did it start right away?    Was it all at once?    You get what I am saying.    I am not even sure if I AM going to have weight loss, in fact on today, Day 6 - is the first day I showed weight loss:    2-3 pounds - so stay tuned for more updates, I know I can't wait to see if it continues.    And, by the way, my eating has not changed and I can't exercise due to a debilitating back condition - so this is my only hope for some weight loss which I hope will help my back which may then allow me to exercise - it is a catch 22.    I will post a separate blog post on that.    Anyway, I wanted to direct people to my blog...     you can ready my posts at:http://zen5.meI look forward to hearing from you!

FAML	Any parents of bipolar children have advice on mood stabilizers?	Hello.    My bipolar son is seven, and his Depakote and lithium are not doing the job for mood swings anymore.    He does not have depressive symptoms--he gets manic and hears voices when he is stressed so we also have him on a low dose of risperidone and also Abilify (which has been our miracle drug).    Mood swings are getting worse and he is getting more aggressive at home (hits walls).    Besides getting him a punching bag, I wondered if anyone has had better experience with a different mood stabilizer--maybe something new?    We tried tegretol with no effect when he was first diagnosed.    Lamactal is not indicated, since he does not need anything with antidepressive effects.    Would appreciate any advice.    Oh--and he is also on a nutritional therapy program, which has helped with his attention deficits but not with his auditory hallucinations or much with the mood swings.    Advice anyone?	auditory hallucinations|depressive symptoms|diagnosed

She's had a constant headache for the past five days, a pounding headache right over her right eye. Whenever she stands up quickly, or she's been standing up for to long she gest quite dizzy and the dizziness only recedes whenever she sits down and puts her head down. Her headaches make it insanely hard to concentrate. Odd colored spots on her skin on her rib area appeared about a month ago and have only been getting more noticable and more have been appearing. They look like birth marks, but they are slightly raised and are brown near the middle and red around the edges. About the same time she formed those spots she started to just randomly get sick on some days. Vomiting and a loss of appetite, but no fever. Here one day gone the next off and on.

DISE	should i remove my ovaries	I am a brca1 carrier who was diagnosed with non invasive, non hormone receptive in situ breast cancer. However as a precaution, 4 gynocologists are pushing hard for me to remove my ovaries to prevent ovarian cancer. I personally don't understand it and I'm having a hard time accepting this only option. I've asked to be monitored on a regular basis every 4 or 6mths( ultrasounds along with c125 and a ct scan) but I'm told these tests are pretty much useless! I have gone thru a double mastectomy and reconstruction and the only reason why I didn't hesitate going to that extreme is because I was diagnosed with BC and the gene. Also, it meant i didn't need chemo and radiation. So to me that was a no brainer decision. In the ovaries case though, i have no idea what to do and it's because there are no symptoms, all tests are normal and my ovaries are fine. No suspecious cysts, no cramps etc... WHY take them out? WHY not get monitored and checked properly and vigidently?I cannot believe for a second that early detection is not possible if you are doing all the right things......it's crazy!

In Jan 2009 I was assigned to a new doctor, and she had seen me before and remarked that I needed the pain meds, fought with my insurance company to make them pay for them, and has called in my refills every    month since.    A few    months ago I lost my TennCare, and though I've no idea about Obama's new plans, I'm uninsurable, and disabled, have no income to speak of to purchase my own insurace.    On the 20th of this month I got a letter from my doc saying she would no longer refill my pain meds, tho she'll continue with my other chronic problems. She does know Im uninsured and has offered to see me free, tho I havent taken advantage of the offer since I lost my tenncare (for having no minor children). After being on pain meds 14 years, and for about 8 months its been Oxycodone, 30 mg, 1-2 every 6 hrs (have intestinal absorption problems and metabolism problems due to gaucher), I know I'm about to get very very sick.    My previous doc told me I'd have a heart attack in the 3rd week once when i tried to quit pain meds on my own to prove i could. I've kept all appointments, have never tried to fill my meds early, I've done all I could. I dont know why she decided this now. What can I do. I hate being medically addicted, always have, but I dont want to be that sick.    I swear to you I'm a good girl and have not abused anything, not the relationship, not the meds, not done anything wrong.

DEMO	Monarch/Sparc sling surgery	I had surgery 2 weeks ago for stress incont. had the sparc sling placed. Before surgery I would leak if I slipped, ran sneezed, coughed, etc. When I would leak, I could feel it. Now that I've had the surgery, I have to wear a panty liner all the time.... otherwise my panties would be damp all the time. I hope that I'm still just in the process of healing.... but I'm afarid I may have just traded one problem for another. Like I said, before surgery I could tell when I would leak.... now I don't feel any leakage, but my panties are always damp now. Was the sling place correctly, I just want this to work!!!	said|sneezed

SOCL	Cut/tear on the inside of my vagina	During sexual foreplay, my guy scratched my vagina very badly. The cut is to the left on my vagina - quite close to the hole. It is at least an inch long and is quite deep. It really hurts to wee and i actually have to hold my vagina whilst weeing to take away the pain! I am really worried that the guy may have had dirty nails and I want to do everything to prevent an infection. Do you think I need to go to the doctors about this? Is there anything I should/shouldn't use to keep it clean? How long do you think it will take to heal? What can i do for the pain?Thanks.	infection|vagina|scratched|nails|cut|pain

DISE	What could be causing my tremors and twitching?	I have been experiencing for quite a few years what might be very short brain spasms which I thought were mini-strokes.    I would feel them coming on, the would last a few seconds, then it would take me a few minutes to get oriented again.    Now, a few months ago, I noticed a slight tremor in one finger and it has steadily seemed to be increasing.    Last night, I had a hard time getting to sleep because my body seemed to be twitching in various spots.    I am very worried.    I had as a child what they thought was polio or rheumatic fever where I could not walk for a couple of weeks.    But it went away.    I get weak sometimes, but it might be due to worry.    I have occasional headaches which my doctor said was from worrying and anxiety.    I am worried about Lou Gehrig's disease or Parkinson's or a brain tumor.    Should I insist on a MRI and are any of these symptoms of these three disorders?

GOAL	Vitreous detachment flashes and pulsation	A few weeks ago I experienced flashes of light in right eye , right side of vision. I then experienced reduced vision with 1000's of black dots and a larger floating mass that actually gets in the way of my vision looking straight ahead. I can see but two levels worse than just before the event.    I still see the flashes, especially in low light situations and when I am trying to look to the right while driving at night. It seems to flash more when I am tired. I also feel my heart beat pulse in the same eye when my heart rate is increased by getting up from a sitting position and other minor activities. I visited a retinal specialist who dialated the eye and gave me a thorough exam.    He did not know why my pulse can be felt and seen. He did not know why I had experienced the vitreous detachment. He told me the flashes were harmless and that as long as my condition did not worsen that I should just get use to the flashes etc    He cn see the vitreous pulling away from the retina but is not concerned.    He saud my retina looked good and he felt it was not prone to tearing. He said my eye was first healthy one he had look at in a month compared to his regular patients.Am I ok to just let it go a this point and hope it gets better or should I go another step? The symptoms bother me but I can live with them if I have to.Rick	right eye|vitreous|can live|condition|retina|minor|said|light|symptoms|tired|retinal|heart|eye|right

FAML	My 8 (almost 9) year old son bites	My main question is, what is the significance, if any of an 8 year old still biting?My son recently just got in trouble at school for biting a boy that held up his hand to him. This was the second time in a week that he acted out. The first incidence was him throwing a rock at a boys leg during recess who isn't nice to him. My son is the oldest of 4 kids. He is very brilliant, i.e. reads a full chapter book every other day. A year ago we've moved to another country where we enrolled him in that countries school. He had a difficult time adjusting. After moving again (within a    year) closer to the city with a big yard for the kids to play in, he is now in the American School. He likes it a lot better there. And we ask him how he likes it and he says he does and seems to be doing a lot better. We went back to our old town and he didn't even want to be there at all. We also had a fire at the old house, (a laptop caught on fire) and it was pretty traumatic for all of us. Not sure if that could be related to anything.He occasionally bites his brother (closest to him in age who's 6) at home when he felt like his space was violated. He's not using his words to communicate which we try and often reinforce for him to do. He gets in trouble for this but nothing seems to work (taking away toys, or video games which he's only allowed to play on the weekend anyways etc). This is the first time he has acted aggressively like this outside the home.The school is recommending him see the school pshychiatrist which my husband and I are hesitant in doing. Is this something that he will grow out of, and will sending him to the school psychologist make it into a bigger deal than normal? Or is it a good idea to have him go talk to someone other than us the parents. I met with the school psychologist (we are limited in our options in another country) and she seemed nice. However, when I mentioned wanting to sit in on the first few meetings with him, the mood got really weird and she didn't like that at all and said that it won't happen. I'm protective of my son who is sensitive in the first place and want to do the best thing for him.

SOCL	Overactive sex drive?	I never really thought much about it till recently. A lot of my ex boyfriends and my current boyfriend have all told me they feel like the girl in the relationship because I'm ALWAYS wanting to have sex. It isn't just one guy because it's happened to all of my boyfriends. Here is a example: My boyfriend and I have sex AT LEAST once a day. Sometimes multiple times a day and he NEVER starts it's always ME wanting it. And I don't know how to control it or if it's a addiction I have. He never gets a break from it and if I don't get it, I get extremely upset or angry. But when I do I never get the satisfaction I want out of it, I mean I orgasm, but it never seems to be enough. Is there something medically wrong with me?	lot

FAML	where to I find patience and tolerance?	"This is my first post, and I come in hopes of insight and understanding, ... not judgment. I have two children, both girls ages 11 and 8, and they are as different as night and day.My 11 year old is easy, I never feel a need to question how things are going with her.    My 8 year old, not so much, ... Don't get me wrong I love Bean, and I live for her, I'd die for her.     Since birth, Bean has been a trial, everything about her took more work, more patience, more understanding.    Everything is a struggle,    every situation is filled with whining and anxiety..    ( and she isn't the only one I find myself resorting to whining)    I feel that we very rarely get moments where she and I can just enjoy each other,... I just want to be able to have happy mommy moments with her and for her, where I'm not constantly saying "" don't pick your nose"" ,"" use manners"" , ""that was hurtful"" , "" you aren't listening"", ""don't hurt your sister"", ""don't spit"" ,"" make good choices""."" Make good choices"" has become my mantra, and I can see she is bothered by my constantly trying to get her to do right,    .... I hate discipline, I really do, it breaks my heart to hear her cry when I have put her to bed early or send her to her room,... I usually end up in tears too.I find it so hard to be tolerant, I want to be a good mother to her but I don't feel like I am, I get so easily annoyed, and frustrated with her.    She's 8 and I feel like I'm still teaching her things she should have mastered at 2, like using a fork, or toilet paper.The whining, I can handle mostly, I just tell her it wont be tolerated that whatever she's whining about I wont help with or do it with her, sometimes that works, sometimes I have to just leave the room.I have actually asked around to friends I trust, asked if she's likable, and everyone loves her, she's great for her teachers, she does have a non behavior related learning disability, but she does well in school.     She takes martial arts, and does well there, she's 8 and a blue belt, which is two from black.When she was small we would say, she will outgrow it... it will get better,... but she's 8 and I don't see any of it being resolved.I have to control everything concerning Bean, even her food intake, because she just seems to know no limits, its what she wants , when she wants, no matter what the consequences.She's rude, and as hard as I try to correct, redirect, and teach, I don't seem to make a dent in this, .... is it wrong to say I don't want this to be her personality?     She says things to people , strangers, in public, that she shouldn't say... like... "" why do you have a beard? "" to a woman, or "" I cant stand here mom, this guys butt stinks"" .I try so hard not to compare her to her sister, who is a polar opposite, strangers come to me to say how well mannered and behaved she is...    I don't know, maybe I'm asking too much...On the other hand, and there is always two sides... I feel it would be very unfair for me not to point out all the good in my Bean,    She is intelligent,very funny and very sweet, very loving, and devoted, gentle, and giving, she never intentionally hurts anyone, not emotionally or physically, she goes out of her way to be a good friend, and really does seem to want to please.     This isn't a bad kid, ... she really isn't, I just seem to have no tolerance for the progress we haven't made. I think I'm the problem, not Beanie.I don't know what I'm hoping to find here now that I wrote all of this, I don't want to sound like I'm putting her down, I just want to find tolerance and understanding that should come naturally with motherhood."	heart|beard|nose|hand|trial|right|correct

GOAL	What is the main problem?	I have mild ARMD both eyes and glaucoma in one eye.    The one eye with glaucoma has faded vision, and lesser color identification.    Amsler grid for both eyes okay, but glaucoma eye is grayer and less pronounced.    I have great difficulty reading with the 'bad' eye, with a spottyness across the field of vision.    Original diagnosis of this condition was that I had a cataract.    Then when glaucoma came up as the diagnosis, the cataract has always been considered mild-1 or 2 scleral.    Being highly myopic, wouldn't any form of cataract make my vision acuity more difficult?    I do see 20/30 witht he bad eye, and 20/20 with the good one.    But the bad eye shows more fading in the last four months.    Retina doctor says it's not macula, w/oct results to support, and he says maybe it's glaucoma.    glaucoma specialist says the optic nerve is unchanged over the last two years (term of my first alert about the disease)    What is the cause of faded vision-glaucoma, or mild ARMD or cataract?	glaucoma eye|optic nerve|condition|glaucoma|scleral|disease|macula|eyes|eye|color

I had no prior indication just was getting ready ffor work, felt like my contact fell out of my eye, went about my business of getting ready looked in the mirror and all I could see was pupil-no eye color left, later in the day I di get some eye color back but the pupil continues to be very large and not really going down.    MRI results did show a small 1/2cm of somethin no one is sure what so they are sending me to a neurologist.    I have been doing some reading about Adie's but would like to know how does this just happen?    Will it really stay like this?    Is ther an association of Adie's with brain tumor?    Other postings have talked about headaches, and eye pain is this normal and will it go away.    The drops didn't really decrease the size of the pupil sooo I guess I am just worried and wanted to know moe about Adie's.Thanks for any help u can send my way	Adie's tonic pupil|headaches|pain|retina|Adie|pupil|brain|eye|color|back
TRMT	A Christian Meditation  (Psalms) :)	"Christian MeditationWhat is Christian meditation?Answer: The biblical passages that use the phrase ""Christian meditation"" are few. Both words ""meditate"" and ""meditation"" are found about eighteen times in the Old Testament. There are basically two Hebrew words which are translated ""meditate,"" found in Genesis 24:63; Joshua 1:8; Psalm 1:2; 63:6; 77:12; 119:15, 23, 48, 148; and 143:5. The Hebrew word ""hagah"" is given the meaning in the context of these verses to ""ponder, imagine, meditate, mourn, speak, study, talk, utter, etc."" Further meaning of meditation is given in the Hebrew word ""aiyach"" when it is used to mean ""to ponder, to converse with oneself, and hence aloud; to utter or commune, complain, declare, meditate, muse, pray, speak, talk with (God in prayer, etc.) or it could be with another believer or group of believers--speaking one's thoughts about a passage of Scripture or words to a hymn, etc.The word meditation is used in Psalm 5:1; 19:14; 49:3; 104:34; 119:97, 99. A familiar verse in Psalm 19:14 states, ""Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in Thy sight..."" He asks that his words and thoughts be equal. Words of the mouth are a sham if they are not backed up by meditation of the heart.A passage in the New Testament gives an even greater meaning as to application of this word ""meditate (meditation)."" The Greek word used is ""meletao"" which means ""to take care of"" or ""resolve in your mind"" to do these things. This verse is 1 Timothy 4:15: ""Meditate upon these things (preceding verses): give thyself wholly to them;..."" Paul clarifies the words ""save thyself...and others"" in verse 16. ""Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."" Taking heed unto the Word of God (doctrine), you will not be ""giving heed...to doctrines of devils"" (verse 1). This seems to be the contextual meaning of ""save thyself."" The hearers also will be saved from ""giving heed to seducing spirits.""As you can see, then, true Christian meditation is an active thought (thinking, resolving) process whereby one gives himself to study of the Word, praying over it, asking God to give you understanding by the Spirit, putting it into practice in daily life, and allowing it (the Scriptures) become the rule for life and practice as you go about your daily activities. This causes spiritual growth and maturing in the things of God as taught you by His Holy Spirit indwelling you as a believer.http://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-meditation.htmlMay your Christian Meditation bless you with love and peace of mind."	application|passages|heart|active

Ive been having dull crampy pains in my left and right hand side elavating through to my back. I kept going to my doctors as in the past ive suffered from ruptured ovarian cysts and it was a simular pain. my doctor wasnt happy about sending me for an ultra sound as he said my symptoms wernt that of a cyst! he reluctanly reffered me for a ultrasound which showed a 3-4 cm cyst on my right ovary, my left hand side ovary couldnt be located which ive been told can be normal, i have pain on that side also. When returning to my gp i was told they would re scan in 6 weeks, and take co -codamol for the pain, which do nothing. I asked my gp what sort of cyst it was and she said we cant tel from a ultrasound, but its a normal simple cyst. I saw the screen report from the ultrasound and it said my cyst contains solid matter. When ive looked this up it said any cyst with solid matter shouldnt be ignored. Im in pain crying everyday worrying especially about cancer as although im only 28 years old, my whole familys been affected by cancer unfortunatly. I would really appreciated your views, ive had a 2nd opinion from my docs and was told nothing different, i dont want to go back as i feel stupid, and feel ive alwys got something wrong with me. many thanks	right ovary|ovarian|ovary|hand|and right|ultrasound|c section|symptoms|pains|pain|crampy|cysts|said|cyst|screen|scan|back

During this event i get constipated, and when im able to pass gas it is terrible smelling, i get bloated and have to sleep on my back.

Towards the end of this event my stomach and abdoman area feels as though someone has used me as a punching bag....This usually lasts for two nights and three days from start to finish. Afterwards im fine and do not have issues passing stools (no blood in stools either). I have not vomited or anything of that nature.This is what has been accomplished medically with no help.        I had a CT scan (showed nothing abnormal), had a colonoscopy (looked normal with no polyps found), blood work numerious times have been good, no hernia found, had the iodine solution put into the blood system and had the xray taken (everything looked good).

FAML	Different gender siblings bathing together	I have a 6 year old granddaughter and an eight year old grandson, siblings. Their mother comes from an hispanic culture and the children slept with their parents regularly for years and still do occasionally. Since my granddaughter was old enough to be in the bathtub the children have bathed together and still do. This weekend they were visiting at our home and after their bath were in a downstairs bedroom watching    TV. My grandson yelled up the stairs asking if he could take his shirt off. He was told no by his parents. When they came back upstairs, my granddaughter's pajama top was buttoned incorrectly. There was a discussion about what she was doing and my grandson admitted he had taken his shirt off and my granddaughter had unbuttoned hers. My husband also noticed when he went downstairs to make sure everything was turned off, that the bed looked like someone had been under the covers. Is this normal behavior? At what age should siblings of different genders stop bathing together. My daughter-in-law believes that her son will tell her when he feels uncomfortable. I have a great-niece and nephew that shared a bedroom for many years and when the nephew was about 14 and his sister 12 he sexually molested her, so I am probably more sensitive than most people. Am I being overly sensitive?	discussion|bathing|bathed|bath|back|watching

FAML	At my wits end.. please help me and my son!!	My son Zane.. is three years old.. not interested in potty training.. smart as a whip.. and is extremely intelligent. Sometimes it seems.. its a bit scary.. he can say the ABC's... he can make the sound of each letter. count to 20.. and is starting to read.    he is number 7 ... my oldest child is 20. ... and he is the youngest. Here is my problem..Zane will not eat regular food.    He is still eating third foods from Gerber.    I am at my wits end.    The only reason i can think that he does not eat real food .. is that his father did not teach him this important rule of thumb while i was in school 10hours a day when zane was 4 months... i was in school for about 2 years.    Then .. i started a job.. worked a year..and couldnt take it anymore.. Zanes dad is a wonderful.. awesome.. doting father.. but the one thing he did not do. is teach Zane to eat regular food. so here we are . trying to fix this. Zane will however.. eat a whole serving of In and Out french fries.. cheezits.. cookies.. ect ect.    But when i place chicken... or mac and cheese.. or anything else in front of him.. he shakes his head violently.. I have gone so far as to place the mac and cheese in his mouth.. and he begins wretching.. sometimes..    he will vomit.. then he looks at me with his huge blue eyes.. and says.. IM sorry mommy.    He really means it..and i just want to cry.. He is above average height... great weight.. and due to the third foods.. is not malnurished at all.. But this has got to change.should i just continue with the third foods??should i become mommy dearest and force him to eat ??I quit my job because of this... they would not accept him at daycare because he has to be fed.he will not use an eating utensil... and he will only eat soft foods... he will not chew.. he just swalllows. but then when given french fries.. he goes to town.this is my 7th child.. and i have never had this concern.    hes not even th eleast bit interested in potty training.and yet.. he can build a boat with legos.. or dial his home phone number.... he can add... subtract.. and has begun to read kinder books.any ideas???	shakes|weight|wretching|thumb|head|ect
FAML	My 5 1/2 year old son has been pooping in his pants for almost 2 years and now I ...	Hi all this is a GREAT website!I have a 5 1/2 year old son who is adopted.    Yes, he comes from a traumatic background but has adjusted well and we also adopted his two other older siblings.    He has no health problems and is INCREDIBLY smart!    He is in Kindergarten and is a fantastic student!    He started pooping in his underwear 1 1/2 years ago.    In the last 1 1/2 we have tried everything, basic skills training, day treatment, therapy, counceling, play therapy, spankings, time outs, loss of privileges (sp), cleaning out soiled pants by hand, back in diapers, drs appts, losing toys, positive reinforcement, charts, timed toilet breaks and even being on Santa's naughty list!UGH!!!!!I am at a total loss.    It is as if he has encoporesis (sp) but he isnt constipated at all.    He is also not ashamed or embarassed of it either.    He is back in diapers now 100% of the time because I am tired of the gross underwear, poo in the sink and shower and having to bleach everything.    His siblings no longer want to play with him and his brother who shares a room with him wont anymore so we had to put him in the guest room with no toys and told him when he stopped the pooping in his pants he could have him room back with his brother.    Sadly he doesnt seem to mind any of it at all!    He just keeps on pooping, smelling and getting consequences.    He is totally regular and has a very good diet high in fiber and takes fiber supplements as well.    The interesting thing is he only does this at home not at school.    He was warned if it continued this last Christmas Santa wouldn't bring him a toy.    He pooped 2x on Christmas eve and Santa brought him nothing.    He cried but a bit and then went on about his buisness and still pooped in his pants.    I am at a loss with a therapist who is stumped, councelors who are trying all kinds of things and siblings who think he is disgusting and stupid because he just wont stop.    Any thoughts or suggestions??????????	positive reinforcement|play therapy|treatment|therapy|constipated|tired|hand|back

DEMO	has anyone heard of the drug Provera	My OBGYN prescribed Provera- which is a hormone of progesterine- for me 3 days ago because my period would not stop I was bleeding for 20 days, never had bleed that long. My husband and I are trying to have a baby and I am concerned about continuing this medication. My obgyn told me to take it 2 times a day for 14 days and it would stop my bleeding then I would get my period on the 15 day. I know taking this medication will not allow me to get pregnant while on it. My doctor told me it would be resetting my system but I'm not too sure about this drug. The side effects scare me- they state you can develop dark pachetts on your face, which is happening and also I am breaking out into a rash all over my body. I dont want to do anything that would hinder my chance in getting pregnant but I feel I should stop taking this medication, my husband on the other hand is telling me to follow the doctors orders- he really wants a baby too. My obgyn is very clear that we are trying to conceive, that is the reason I started seeing her in the first place and she assures me there is no reason why I would not be able to get pregnant after showing her my pelvic ultra sound results. I just do not feel right with this medication and on the label it states do not take if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Can someone please give me their opinion. I am so confused and worried. I dont know if I should stop the medication or not. Any opionion would be greatly appreciated. thanks	stop medication|pelvic|body|hand|face|rash|right

We have been receiving complaints from his teacher that he finishes his class work in 5 minutes (No problem in his work/studies, every day he gets several stars) whereas other children take 20+ mins for the same work. He then starts disturbing other kids and fights with them. He does not listen to his Class Teacher and when looked up angirily in his eyes makes arrogant face. This problem is coming up for the last 6 months and we are not able to get any solution.

GOAL	foggy vision	"I had foggy eyes eight years ago and I was prescribed antibiotics for my eyes.    That took care the ""fogginess"" on my eyes.    This past Saturday when I woke up, my right eye was foggy again.    I waited until today Monday to see my opthamologist.    He did not find anything in my eyes.    No infections, pressure is good and advised to see my optometrist.    i know it is not about my prescription eye glasses, but nevertheless I will still see my optometrist and would    try to see another opthamologist for second opinion.    In the meantime, my question is, will this eventually go away as my opthamologist indicated? I am very concern since he did not prescribed any antibiotics for my eyes.    I was hoping he would, but understood he didn't because he did not find anything in my eyes.    The other question is - what causes this ""fogginess""."	right eye|eyes|antibiotics

I'm not an anxious person.    I'm worried I will have more withdrawals from that if I ever make it through what I'm going through now.    How much can a person take?    And how can anyone go    back and start this cycle over after going through pure hell.    Rat's learn, why can't we.    I know the answer to the last question, I think.    I was on meds for pain, but have had surgery and am better.    I never did anything illegal or anything, but I did take more than I should have to ease other pains.

GOAL	White tongue/Mono	About 1 month ago, I had a terrible sore throat and had ulcers forming.    I was put on antibiotics and within a day, my tongue was white and the ulcers had worsened.    I was tested for mono and it came back positive.    Since, my throat has gotten better, but my tongue is still white.    I went back to my doctor, who put me on a medication for thrush, however the tongue hasn't gotten any better.    The white tongue looks almost fuzzy on top and cannot be scraped off.    Any scraping or brushing results in irritated bumps on the tongue and bleeding.    Another mono test revealed a second positive mono test, however do I need to be worried about the tongue?

She has tried different lubrications etc. She has gone to the doctor several times. Her husband has also been checked out. Both of their doctors say there is nothing wrong. They are unsure what is causing the pain.Her husband is divorced...his ex-wife had the same problem...sex was very painful and she too had a miscarriage.She has been TTC for so long and i wondered if whatever is causing the pain could also be causing the miscarriage or infertility?She has been taking clomid for about 5 months and has had Laporoscopy surgery.I wanted to see if anyone else has went through anything similar and have any advice.TTC they are having to have sex A LOT, and it is very difficult for her because the pain is exrutiating at times.	painful|pain|LOT
TRMT	Worst experience ever!!! Getting iud removed now!	I had my implanon removed from my arm on friday 9/7/2012, very quickand painless. I decided to get the Mirena instead of the implanonagain since It would last 5 years versus only 3 years. It was the mostexcruciating pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I scream whenshe first had to measure my uterus and then screamed again when sheactually inserted the Mirena. I was given 800mg of Ibprofen before theprocedure, which didnt help at all. I am glad I had someone there todrive me, I cried the whole way home from the intense cramping. When Igot home all I could do was lay in the bathtub with warm/hot water totry to soothe the pains. The pain wouldnt go away. I took a 500mgvicodin and laid down to try to go to sleep but couldnt because then Istarted to get nauseous. So I started to throw up. Im guessing it wasfrom the vicodin. I hadnt eaten anything since that morning. I couldntmake a bowel movement for about 2 days. I was so scared to go becausei didnt want to push the mirena out after i had gone through all ofthis. I would never ever do this again. It was the worse experienceever. It is now 11/2/2012, ive still been having sharp pains in my uterus, and now I have noticed my strings are hanging way lower than before. i am also having pregancy symptoms. Throwing up, moody, and other things. I have an appointment on Monday to get it removed.

SOCL	Septate hymen? I'm unsure and worried	"Right, so several months ago I had difficulty and pain in removing a tampon and when I removed it, still felt uncomfortable or like something was still 'inside' me. I told my mum and she got me checked over at the hospital to make sure I didn't have any tampon left inside so I didn't get toxic shock. They said I was fine and nothing was there, calming my nerves but still leaving me suspicious. I let it go though, trusting a doctor's word.Later, I found a 'loop' or 'string' attaching from one side of my vagina to the other, quite high up inside my vagina. It didn't attach the vagina walls like they were sewn together, just touched both sides. Like i said though, it was high up and i had difficulty to reach it. I didn't worry too much so didn't really search/research into it too heavily on the internet and so I didn't find anything.Last night, I again had difficulty removing a tampon, to start with i just thought i was clenching my muscles too much and the tampon was simply being held there, but i was fully relaxing, no matter how much i was panicking and managed to pull the tampon into sight. I saw a pinky line on the tampon and went to touch it. Being aware of the inside of my vagina, recognised the texture and acknowledged it as skin. I tried to unhook it from that angle but it was impossible so i had to push the tampon back inside and unhook it there, pulling the tampon out to one side.I'm assuming the loop of skin holding the tampon in is the same loop i found high up in my vagina a while ago, and also the same thing which got me going to a doctor the first time. The only difference is that the first time I didn't stretch the loop so much compared to now, and it is in the opening of my vagina now, not really high up. I took a mirror and had a look and the loop is very thick, but when pinched is painless, not even the slightest sensation can be felt. It is a red colour when not stretched, but when stretched turns more pink like what i saw when it was stretched around the tampon. It is now very large and long and almost has the appearance of an earth worm, which is gross I know, and pokes out of my vaginal entrance. I'm assuming this is because I stretched it so far to see it on the tampon, but in the mirror it also looks like i've pulled the whole of the inside of my vagina down with it.I researched into this last night and all of today, and the closest thing i could find was a septate hymen. This is an uncommon case where your hymen or ""cherry"" splits across your vagina forming two entrances; almost like this (I). Most descriptions are the same as mine, (preventing easy removal of tampons etc) but it is also described to be at the entrance of your vagina. My 'loop' was first found high up inside my vagina, but it was much more tightly taught and felt a lot better condition to what it is now; at the entrance and long a saggy. Also, i'm not a virgin. I've been sexually active for over a year and as far as i'm concerned it has never been a problem, but it also would've broken by now if it was a hymen, wouldn't have it?Now i've stretched it i can always feel something there, just in my vagina. It pokes out and i'm worried it's going to be a problem; to me physically and during intercourse. Am i damaged? Will it return back to normal?

FAML	6 month old's change in behaviour	"I have a 6 month old baby girl. About two months ago she had an episode of eyes rolling back and liquid coming from nose and tears from eye. It happened a couple in a row. After that, she was pretty quiet (comparing to her normal behaviour)    for about 5 days.We got her to her doctor, who said that everything is fine ""babies can do weird things"", and also we got her to ER, but again the doctor there, said she was ok. He suggested to do en EEG to rest our mind. WE have scheduled an EEG for September 19(    which is so far away, and my worries are terrible).After all this happened,    then she was pretty good I would say, as always she was. Then again around 10-15 days ago, she began to be a little more fussy than usual(of course she had her 6 month's shot 10 days ago, and doctor said that she might be teething, she noticed a little swelling). She becomes very fussy especially in her high chair, she sometimes grunts so much, that makes me think something is going on. She has reached her milestones up to now in an impressive way. Now she is challenging herself into crawling. She smiles , but I hardly can make her laugh out. She babbles(not a lot though) too.    Also, she rubs her eyes    even when she is not sleepy, and make noise with her nose (like a runny nose). She plays with her toys, but she likes most to play with burp clothes and stuff like that, she likes to pull them.    Do you think there is a problem with my daughter?

This week he sad to start using condoms and I have been confused on when to start using the condoms. I have also been using the ovulation test to help me guess because you can't use condoms everyday. My husband and I have sex everynight. Well, we had sex last night and I took my test today and it shows that I am ovulating already. I am so scared.

SOCL	More than 400 people dead in Pakistan flooding	Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Flooding caused by monsoon rain has killed more than 400 people across Pakistan, a provincial government official said Friday.Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province information minister, said the death toll is now 408 people in that province and 25 in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry, the head of the Pakistan meteorological department, told CNN the 300 mm, or 11.8 inches, of rain recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the most ever in Pakistan.Many of the victims died when floodwaters swept away hundreds of mud houses in parts of Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Tank, according to Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a provincial minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops and dozens of government buildings, local businesses and schools, Bilour said.Hussain said floodwater has cut off the Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Peshawar. There is no way to get to these areas by road, he said.Earlier Friday the head of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said flooding had killed at least 150 people and injured 90 since Wednesday. Retired Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmed said 90 people were still missing.The Pakistani Air Force is helping with rescue efforts, spokesman Tariq Yazdanie said in an interview on Pakistani TV.The recent torrential rains have broken all previous records of rainfall in the country, he said.The U.N. refugee agency dispatched the first shipment of aid for flood victims in the region Thursday, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported.APP said the supplies include 585 tents, 2,700 plastic sheets, 1,760 kitchen sets and 4,000 plastic mats.At the same time, a top official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province pressed Pakistan's president for help, according to APP.The news agency said Assembly Speaker Karamatullah Khan told legislators he had asked President Asif Ali Zardari for a supply of emergency boats.Photographs from Getty Images showed flood victims struggling to cross a swollen river in the town of Nowshera. The pictures showed children being ferried across the water in overcrowded boats, and more able-bodied people helping the elderly to higher ground.Supplies from the U.N. agency will go first to the two hard-hit villages of Talli and Sultan Kot in Sibi district, APP said.The U.S.-based group Save the Children said it will distribute plastic sheeting for shelters, household supplies and hygiene kits to about 1,000 families over the next two days.Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.	flooding|Flooding|crops|head|cut|said
GOAL	Big decision tomorrow - input welcomed	"I have two different IOLs now as result of cataract surgery. The left eye received Crystalens 10/04. Due to lack of any distance vision, instead of using Crystalens for right eye, doc suggested ReSTOR, so I received ReSTOR in right eye last Thursday. I have adequate distance vision to drive (read large signs, speed limit signs, etc.), watch TV, etc. now with the ReSTOR...as long as the distance isn't too far away. Shoud the distance continue to improve with ReSTOR?The Crystalens is giving me good intermediate and near. I also have some near with ReSTOR, but I have to hold reading material about 8"" from my eyes. Tomorrow I meet with my doc to decide whether to explant the Crystalens and replace it with ReSTOR. Based on tests he did last week, he thinks the Crystalens is not moving at all to accomodate. However, it seems that the fact that I am able to see well intermediate (3' - 4' away) to near means it must be moving some. Beyond about 5 or 6 feet though, things become blurry with the Crystalens (such as TV)...things across the room.I spoke with a rep at Eyeonics yesterday who told me that if the refraction tests can remove the blurriness, there are some options for my Crystalens eye, including contact, piggyback IOL and lasik. When my doc did the refraction test on this eye (about 7 days post-op), all distances were blurry, but that may have been because it was too soon to have cleared up. Is it likely that could have been the case. If I can't find a refraction that gives me clear distance, it seems like that would mean something else is wrong with my eye.Please make any suggestions you feel are appropriate as time to do an explant is running out (we're supposed to make that decision in the morning) and I have been in a constant state of anxiety over making the best choices. I don't mind wearing glasses for driving if necessary. My major usage of eyes is in my painting (artwork) and computer usage. I am hoping that insurance will cover the surgery costs of lens exchange. The doc said he would not charge me for the exchange.Thank you so much.jefields"	cataract surgery|lasik|right eye|left eye|eyes|feet|eye|lens|said
GOAL	Could my chronic eye conditions be related to a pituitary tumor?	Starting just over three years ago I developed chronic multiple bilateral para-central scotomas, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and dozens of daily random occurrences of photopsia, I also developed a dysfunction of my iris causing sudden onset and persistent bilateral nasal corectopia, and dysfunction of the ciliary muscles leading to terrible night vision and random bouts of myopia or hyperopia.I have had four eye exams now and my ophthalmologist has said I have no internal or structural defects of the eye, retina or optic nerve. His suggestion is that I have some type of auto-immune condition that is attacking my eyes; but all of my auto-immune tests have now come back as negative.Other systemic symptoms I developed at the onset of the eye issues are, hypertension, heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, breathing difficulty, thinning of skin, dry skin, dry brittle hair, thin brittle finger and toe nails that chip and peel, loss of body hair, chronic nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, joint pain, and random bouts of palmar erythema.I have been evaluated for many different conditions but it has just been    suggested I should look into a pituitary tumor, recently I have had a positive metanephrines test for pheochromocytoma so my endo has me scheduled for an abdominal MRI on Monday, but I' am thinking about asking for the pituitary tumor evaluation when I see him again. What is the likelihood I might have a pituitary tumor, and it is possible I have both a pheo and a pituitary tumor?	breathing difficulty|systemic symptoms|chronic nausea|dry skin|pain|photopsia|abdominal|ciliary muscles|finger|nasal|heart|nails|eyes|hair|eye|toe|abdominal MRI|optic nerve|corectopia|hyperopia|condition|myopia|retina|said|conditions|keratoconjunctivitis|back

You could see the swelling and my panties tight on my stomach. I have had pently of yeast infections before but this doesnt seem the same. I do not have iching, maybe a very very slight discharge. I stopped taking birthcontrol pills back in feburary ( to try and have a baby)and i was on them for 15 to 17 years. My periods for the last couple of times have become regular, maybe +/- a couple of days. I thought maybe it is my body adjusting to the lack of the pills? Could it be me ovulating? Or could it be something worse? The last swelling and burning happened 8 days after my last period about 3 to 4 days ago and there is a very slight burning now.	burning sensation|burning|cramps|stomach|body|uterus|back|birthcontrol pills

TRMT	GOOD NEWS....	Hey Everyone,I just got back from seeing my surgeon.    The pathology report was NEGATIVE.....    We were pretty much expecting that, because he would have known on surgery day if it wasn't looking good.About my infection issue's.    He's ordered me more antibiotics for another week and I'll be off them for one week and then I see him on the 15th for my last follow up.    If there are any more problems with fevers like this past Sunday we're to call right away like we did.    The next step would be to go in the hospital a couple days, so they could resolve it there.    But, my body IS...showing signs of getting rid of the infection.    I'm trusting it'll be gone after this next round of med's.    Lord KNOWS I wouldn't want to go through what they'd have to do to get rid of it in the hospital.    He was VERY FIRM to tell me the seriousness of my letting them know if there are any problems.    He didn't want to scare me, but it's a serious thing if left untreated correctly.    I KNOW that just by how bad off I was Sunday with it.I'm SO RELIEVED and look forward to being released on May 15th.    I'll write you all again on that day with the good news.THANK YOU ALL...........for your LOVE, SUPPORT, PRAYERS, FRIENDSHIP.    ETC....    You all have been GREAT through all this.

SOCL	Calf/tendon injury, now numbness in foot, should I be worried?	"I flew from the US to Europe last week (and am still in Europe). Thus I am a little concerned about DVT.I have gone from walking 10-20 minutes per day to walking 90-120 minutes per day, as is common for tourism in Europe.A few days ago my left calf and Achilles tendon started to hurt. Not a lot. The kind of pain is hard to describe. I thought I had just strained something and should ""walk it off"".The pain has persisted for those days and recently got worse. When I point my foot up and down, instead of feeling a smooth motion, it feels like the tendon is ""bunched up"" and the movement is ""choppy."" From the feeling I would expect it to be swollen, but I can't notice any swelling visually or by touch.Starting this afternoon, if I don't move my foot around every few minutes, it starts to go numb. This has caused me to start wondering about my treatment options and whether or not something more serious is wrong than a slightly strained muscle/ligament.Sorry for posting to the general forum but it doesn't seem like there are specific forums for leg injuries or muscle/tendon injuries oddly enough."

SOCL	I am really confused!	"I have always had a REALLY good relationship with my husband of 6 years. Or at least so I thought! He did something yesterday that blew me away. He came home from work (he works nights), picked something up (not exactly sure what) and left and stayed gone the ENTIRE day on Father's Day no less! He shut the cell phone off all day and I had absolutely no way of speaking to him. I had no clue where he was, what he was doing, if he was alive or dead, etc.Let me go back to some history here. We were each other's high school crush and never knew it. We didn't meet until years after high school and the minute I spoke to him, I felt an incredible ease. It was like I had known him my whole life. We were dating a week and he was already saying that I was the one he was going to marry. It kinda scared me a bit because at the time I wasn't looking for a relationship, but since I liked him so much, I didn't end it and wanted to see where things went. After 6 wks of dating, he proposed, I accepted and we were married 4 months later. A total of 5 months of knowing each other.I have always been the one that is strong in the relationship. He is the cuddle type, I am not. He has expressed to me many times that he wants me to cuddle with him more and I sincerely do my best to oblige. There are times when it's not the most convenient, like when I'm cooking dinner for 4 kids, have a load of laundry in the dryer ready t o be folded and another one going in. Since he works nights AND keeps our children during the day, I don't expect him to really do any housework, but it would be nice if he would at least pick up after himself! I will tell him that if he wants me to cuddle, he could come help me in the kitchen, but he rarely does.Fast forward~ EVERY weekend he is gone doing something, like playing basketball or football, or riding the motorcycle, etc. I am ALWAYS home with the kids by myself and we will go do our own things since daddy isn't home. He announced he was going to start coaching a kids' football team, and none of our kids are even playing! I got upset naturally because I am ALWAYS home and he goes off and does WHATEVER he wants without even discussing it with me. I voiced my objection but it didn't matter. He did it anyway.Now I love my husband so very much, but he makes me so mad sometimes!! When he finally came in last night, I asked him if he wanted to be a part of this family. His answer, ""I do and I don't""    This was news to me!! He said I was too controlling and he feels like he can't talk to me, and I don't cuddle with him and he doesn't feel loved. All of this literally came out of nowhere because we were NOT fighting whatsoever and I had no idea that he was even upset! I do agree I can be a little overprotective sometimes, but I am NOT controlling! He does whatever he wants EVERY weekend, so how in the H3LL is THAT controlling??After talking out some of our issues, the topic turned into him saying that he knows he's selfish, and he's so sorry for running off like that and he understands if I wanted out of the marriage and no one will ever have his heart, even if we split, but me. I was (and still am) extremely confused!! How did it turn from ME being the bad guy to HIM and I didn't even turn it around on him either..lol!Am I missing something here??"	crush|minute I|heart|back|said

FAML	3 month old eats very little	My three and a half year old son has food aversions and now my three month old son is showing signs of the same.    He was eating like a champ, but about four weeks ago started fighting us to eat.    He has reflux, which my older son did not, so I am hoping the reflux is the culprit and not feeding disorders.    What do you think?    He is about fourteen and a half pounds and was taking in 28 to 32 ounces.    Now we are lucky if we get 18 to 20, and that is not without a fight.    I think he might have a slight cold, as we are all sick in the house, but other than that, there is no reason for this behaviour.    He is still a happy guy, smiling and cooing all the time, but I am a sick, worried mess!    Could it be that 2 to 3 ounces every 3 to 4 hours is all he needs?    Please advise.    I have already set up a feeding team consult with my older son's hospital just in case, but I am hoping that you might tell me that what he is eating is fine for him.    Maybe I am just too crazy about this because of what we have already been through with our other son.    Another note, he is a gassy mess.    He passes wind constantly and seems to be in great discomfort over it, especially while eating.    THis is why we walk, bounce, distract and whatever else it takes to get him to eat the little he does. Mylecon does nothing.	disorders|wind|discomfort

GOAL	Blurred vision after reading	My vision blurrs after several minutes when reading with bifocals which I have read with for years and only recently am having the problem. I am 73.    The longer I read, the worse it gets. The blurring lasts for at least an hour+ and affects both the reading and long distance through my normal distance part of my glasses.    If I read without my bifocals, I have to put the readiing material very close and it is somewhat blurred.    But, after I read w/o glasses for an hour, my vision, both near and far are normal with my glasses.    My Opthomologist is perplexed by the problem, and I am going to try other experiments to see what the results are.    I will read with a pair of distance glasses from at least an arms length and see if it creates any blurring.    I am doing that right now and it does not seem to create any blurring.    I then plan to cover one eye while reading with my bifocals and see what happens.	arms|eye|right|minutes

GOAL	Treatment for dilated pupil (traumatic mydriasis) or all the other eye problems	Hi, I am a girl in Shanghai, China, who has been suffered from traumatic mydriasis since an accident caused by a kid throwing his toy towards me Oct 6, last year, very unfortunately.I've been search for a solution since Oct 24, when I found it is a huge problem. It is not long for me to find out the western treatment is not helpful at all, just as the information I got in this forum. And the doctors and experts tried to persuade me into getting into the situation, which, for me, is not satisfied at all. Then some experts suggest me to try some traditional Chinese treatment. So I tried Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese acupuncture. Well, the herbal medicine did work well for the first few day, as I can see the grids of the window in my room instead of just a very vague view. It did work well since then, so I quited drinking it after Chinese New Year, that is, early this Feb. ( I am still suffering acnes by product of the herbal medicine as it is too 'hot'. And I have shallow puncture with cupping treatment every week, unbelieveablely painful and not cured yet.)Last but not least, the most amazing thing is acupuncture. I'M CURED. At first it is very strange when the doctor put that needle in my head, espically in my orbit, sometimes you'll feel full and sometimes you'll feel sour, not just painful. I mean, it is not so painful after serveral weeks of treatment, you'll get to use to it. It's even more strange when you're connected to the electric lines, with which it will help you recover better. I can feel improvements since the first two weeks and until this June. I just did a VEP test in the most prestigous ophthalmic hospital this afternoon and a shoot for my eyeground two months ago. And all the tests, including the eyeground check shows that I'm definitely cured, with minor mydriasis still, of course much much better.And the best thing is, I am not the only one there to get the great treatment. A lot of patients have been there for years or even decades. Most of them are told they are inevitability going to be blind soon or eventually, by the ophthalmologists. Some of them are getting better, and some of them are not. Well,    as the doctor told me, their cells have already been ruined, and it is not in the transformation process. He can help you cure it if it is still in the transformation process. The good news is that you won't get any worse for almost all kinds of problems. ( Only very few people who does not feel better. Maybe, acupuncture is not a good idea for nervous breakdown. Two guys is been having the treatment for a long time, and they do not feel any better. I think maybe it is the God idea to let them leave the noisy city and go to the countryside, or even live in the forest, ideally.) The doctor serves for up to 70 patients a day, 5 days a week, sometimes for one o'clock to seven or eight o'clock without rest. That's is really very incredible as he is already over 60. The patients have to wait even 3 hours to get the treatment, more than one hour for a fast pass, I mean, he is really popular even there is actually no information in any kinds of forum yet. Almost all new patients are recommended by ophthalmologists in other hospital.It is certainly not a wise advice to go to China for the treatment,    cause it need a very long process, or even the rest of your life. (I bet you know if the doctor told that you are going to be blind, and you'll very willingly to have that treatment for the rest of your life to avoid it.) You can find a very very very great acupuncturist with a lot of expertises for help. Just a tip if you got black and blue by acupuncture, as it will happen from time to time since your acupuncturist don't have a lot people to practice for eye problem, cover the area with ice and the first 24 hours, and after that, covered with boiled eggs and you can always boil the egg again to let it be hot.And I'm unemployed for two months, please don't hesitate to contact me if your Shanghai office is hiring a new secretary. (I have four years of experiences.)

I have been on it this time for exactly one year july 17th. I am down to 51 mgs as of last friday. I was only up to 70 this time. I was slowly tapering and got down to 33 mgs. I started a new job and due to sweating/metabolizing my dose, I strted to fell very bad in the mornings and by the evenings, most of my comfort had diminished severily. I ended up increasing by ten and then another ten 2 weeks later. I am thinking about going away to an inpatient facility in september when my children start school. They live with their father as of now but summertime is usually my time to spend with them so I would like to wait until school starts so they do not loose out on our quality time. I am ready....mentally, I know I will be ok. I belong to a 12-step fellowship and have a lot of support. I am very nervous though because my health is not that great due to an infection i contracted during drug use. The infection spread to my heart, lungs, bones, brain & so on... I almost died and then had a high chance of becoming a vegetable for the rest of my life...... I know what I need to do but I am scared....

PREG	twins or just one baby?	At my 12 weeks appointment my doctor couldn't detect a heartbeat. So I went back at exactly 14 weeks. He used the doppler on my right side of my lower abdomen and instantly found a strong heartbeat of 160 bpm. He then used it on the left side and he also picked up a heartbeat. They both sounded a lot alike but couldn't tell if it was an echo from the one baby or a seperate heartbeat. He also didn't time it. I was wondering how common it is for one baby heartbeat to echo to the other side or is it more likely to be a seperate heartbeat altogether. I'm so anxious, I have a ultrasound in a few days but I just wanted some opinions :-)Also at exactly 14 weeks I was measuring 15 cm from pubic bone to the top of the fundus instead of 14 cm. I'm not exactly sure why I'm a week bigger. I know my exact period date because I've been tracking it just incase of pregnancy. I also miscarried in nov.One last thing, twins do run in my family. My dad and his dad are both twins. Also my moms sister and her grandma are both twins. I'm just looking for suggestions and opinions :-) !

GOAL	YAG and Crystalens	Well I finally submitted to the YAG.    My vision in my left (Crystalens) eye had become so cloudy that it was only useful for intermediate distance vision.    Thankfully the Restor in my right eye was working well for both distance and near.    Although I was still not wearing glasses, working at the computer was becoming increasing more difficult.    I went in yesterday morning for the YAG and WOW, had I forgotten how great I could see right out of my original surgery.    It must have been really cloudy as the doctor made some comments to that effect.    I believe I heard him tell the nurse that it was at a + 3 opacity, whatever that means.    My right eye (Restor lens) is not clouding up so no YAG was done on that eye.First my eye was dilated and numbed, then they placed some kind of lens directly on my eye and used some type of gummy substance to hold it in place.    The surgeon had warned me prior to the procedure about this and he wasnÃ¢ € ™t kidding when he said gummy.    It took hours before my eye flushed that stuff out enough to tell that my vision had improved.    Today I can see very well and if it remains like this I will be most happy.    It really is too early to tell, but I believe some of the glare issues seem to be lessened or gone.    I will take a night drive this evening and know for sure then.The question I now have, is the risks that I was concerned with before (ruptured posterior capsule, fluid moving the lens, etc. Ã¢ € “ the thread seems to be closed now) are they less likely as time goes on?    Do these kinds of complications normally happen during the procedure, shortly after, or does the risk remain the same from now on?Thank you,BStaggsThis discussion is related toYAG and Crystalens.	discussion|procedure|fluid|right eye|flushed|glare|Today|lens|said|posterior|increasing|eye|right
FAML	5 Yr Old Behavior at Preschool	"My son turned 5 in Nov and attends daycare/preschool full time.    Today the daycare director informed me that she received a call from an upset parent regarding something my son said to another 5 year old boy.    He told the other boy that he wanted to see one of their teachers (he mentioned her by name) ""naked and see her privates"".    The other parent called to report this and was upset stating that this was alarming that a 5 year old would say such a thing.    While inappropriate I would not say it was alarming but normal.    I have talked to my son in the past (on a 5 year old's level and what is appropriate for him to be aware of at this age) about privacy, private parts and what is ok and what is not. my daughter is 3 so he is aware of girls and boys and the visible differences.I think this is normal and is not cause for alarm but is cause for me to have a conversation with him regarding what is appropriate and what is not.    Am I on the right track???"	Today|said|inappropriate I|right
FAML	child stuttering	"My son turned 2 in August. He has been speaking very well since the age of 1.    He has a larges vocabulary, and uses sentences and his grammar skills at a level higher than his peers.    He has always developed more quickly than the other children we know at his age.    But recently about a month ago he has began to stutter.    I consider the stuttering to be pretty bad, but he doesnt stutter all of the time.    Mainly with ""w"" words and I. EX. He will say "" wh.. wh...wh..wh..where where where are we going?""    Is this something that I should be concerned about, or is this a normal childhood thing???"	
TRMT	1 week to go...is this normal??	I have just one week to go and although I am nervous and a bit scared I have yet to shed a single tear.    When I had my tubes tied 8 years ago I cried for weeks and when my best friend had a hysterectomy a while back I cried for her but for me I cant seem to cry.    I have been very much on edge lately and find myself snapping at people, especially my kids, for little to no reason and I feel very bad about it but I cant seem to help it.    I am wondering if I am somehow avoiding the feelings I should have or is this the way some people handle it?    I am having my overies removed and will be in surgical menopause so I know I will feel very different afterwards but I wonder if I should be grieving a bit before hand?    Maybe this doesnt make sense, I keep running through everything in my mind over and over again and trying to prepare myself for every situation and I think I am avoiding the feelings more then anything.Sorry for the ramble, trying to work things out I guess.~Hannie333	surgical menopause|sense|back|hand

However, I still had painful urination, pain in my pelvis area, frequency and urgency, and my bladder scan showed my bladder wasn't empyting properly. In May, I had an ultrasound on my kidneys that was perfect. I also had a cytoscopy that showed inflammation in my urethra, so they dialated it. For a few weeks, my symptoms cleared up. At my last checkup in June, my bladder scan showed that I was still not emptying my bladder and the pain came back.

GOAL	DCR	I had a DCR a year and 1/2 ago. After 6 months from the procedure, I started having problems with excessive discharge. Then it became so bad, that I had sharp pain in the left eye (surgery eye). Anyhow, I was then diagnosed with blepharitis, took some antibiotics and use an ointment daily along with scrub cleaning the eye lashes after warm them with compresses. The problem is that I still have problems in the surgery eye, the sharp pain returns ever so often, along with the congestion in the nostril with the new tubing. So, my question is can you have blepharitis in one eye only? Is it a consequence of the surgery? The surgeon had to unplug the new duct once and now he states we may need new surgery. I am really concerned and would like a second opinion, however I live in a rural area without many options. Any suggestions? Thank you.	pain in left eye|sharp pain|cleaning eye|procedure|DCR|blepharitis|lashes|diagnosed|duct|eye|antibiotics|ointment

FAML	5 year old misbehaving in school and stealing	"I have a 5 year old who is in Kindergarten. She has been having a rough time since coming back from Christmas break. She has issues before but they are getting out of control now. She is taking things from other kids and the teacher. She has been very disrepectful and argumentative with the teachers but more with the subs. She has been removed from the classroom and sent to a buddy room to rethink her behavior and still no change. I have punished her with spankings, taking things out of her room, no tv, no fun activities, taken away field trips and nothing. Its like she has no conscious. She tells me she does not know why she does the things with no explanation. I talk with her all the time trying to figure out what the problem is and she knows what she is doing wrong and how she needs to fix it but again she doesn't put those words into actions. I ask her what she needs to do to give her some control of her behavior and it doesnt work. She is a I wouldnt say hyper child but she likes to be busy. Her classroom is structured they work all day long with two recesses. She of course loses the last one due to her behavior. Yesterday she was at school and she took something from the teachers desk, argued with the teacher, hit a student, sent out the room for a while and she took something from the buddy room and pulled a string out the coach and ruined it according to the teacher. I am at my wits end. She thinks she is a DIVA and that she is so cute that she makes her own rules. I have a very firm parent, I have not always been consistent because I always think that maybe she will get it together but she knows I don't play yet she doesn't take my warnings and punishments seriously. My 8 year son knows that his mother don't play and he does so well at school and at home with minor issues. I need some help. I am not feeling this stealing because it has happened at school, home, grandma's and at various stores. I am a Probation officer and I would hate for my child to be in the system. I tried an incentive that if she has good days tha she can earn a quarter an when she gets enough she can purchase something that she wants since she says that she sees things and they are cool so she takes them because she wants them...This too is not working. She doesnt earn the money. I don't know what to do. I have talked to her teacher and we have tried a ""Target Sheet"" to make her accountable for her behavior and she started changing it around to make it look good or not bringing them home...... WHAT DO I DO?"	minor|back|is structured|actions

GOAL	Question about Abscessed tooth	Hello,Over the previous weekend a tooth that I had a crown on that never felt right for the last 2 years since it was done started hurting really bad. By Monday when I went to the dentist my face had swollen up something fierce and my neck as well. Starting at noon on Monday I began taking 300mg of clindamycin every 6 hours for this and a good bit of the swelling has gone as well as most of the pain.However I still have this roughly golf ball sized knot in my cheek that is located right about where it presses against the offending tooth gum line. I can't open my mouth all that far because of it and it hurts a good bit off and on. Based on what I've read on these forums it seems that this is fairly normal and should go down over time but I wanted to post and confirm this. The only other swelling that has hung around is some in my neck but it's right below where this knot is so I am guessing it's related to that.Thanks for any input!	tooth|cheek|face|pain|clindamycin|right
FAML	Help! i dont know what to do anymore!	My son just turned 5- and this year had been a very eventful year for him. He was diagnosed with AD/HD, ODD, and OCD. He is becoming very hard to deal with, he cries over anything and everything. When he doesn't get his way he cries and throws a fit. I can't take him out in public because im affraid he will throw a fit on me and start screaming and crying.    He doesn't listen to anything his Father and I tell him. He is the the total opposite at school, he listens and is polite. He played baseball earlier this year and we had no problems with him, and now he is in football , there are days when we cant get him to the field fast enough because he is ready to tackle and be with him friends, but then there is days when the smallest thing will make him cry for an hour straight. Punishments just do not work with him at ALL. He fights with his 2 yr old sister 90% of the time, when he is mad you cant talk to him, look at him, or anything because he will flip out.    That's his favorite thing to say now ( if you don't do this I'm going to flip out!). I don't know what to do anymore i can already tell his sister is picking up on his behavior. i feel like im failing at parenting because i cant control him. His doctor had him on 10mg of Adderall(adderrall)and 15mg of Lamictal, and i see no change in his behavior=(The doctor has him on 10mg of adderall(adderrall)and 15 mg of Lamictal and i still have not seen a change in his behavior.	diagnosed|fit

My private doctor already give my baby BCG at birth, Three doses of Dtap, and OPV he also completed    Prevenar1. He was due for another vaccination Rotarix1 on June 10, the cost was expensive for this kind of vaccination. So my mother in law bring me in goverment where they are giving free vacination. As I stated, I already finish half of the course, I told them that I need rotarix vaccination. But maybe because of misunderstanding they give me OPV, DtaP, and Hib vacination instead of Rotarix. I asked them it is harmful for my baby? It is any side effects for him. He told me no side effects at all, the baby will be more immuned on the disease. The govement is given only three    injection or doses because more baby need for vaccination maybe it will be shortage.Regarding the Rotarix 1 vaccination can I make a delay and given this next month. Because he already take the said vaccination. I was too much confused and too much tension. Please advice because i am thinking mybe it will    be harmful or have side effects for my baby.Needed for your advice. Thank you	injection|vaccination. I|vaccination|vacination|said|Hib|disease

I'm on a sulfa drug as my antibiotic, this is day 4, and I still have the cramping.My cramping started after my period.    I was sick to my stomach the day following my period, and the cramping started right after.    The cramps feel like contractions.    They were/are coming an hour apart.    My bowel movements aren't the same..I haven't had a real solid movement, yet--I haven't    had an appetite to eat either.    Are these symptoms of a UTI or something more serious?

SOCL	Skin Closing over Labret Piercing	I got my lip pierced around 3 or 4 months ago, and it seemed to have healed with no complications. Then, about four days ago, a small bump appeared on the inside of my lip by the piercing. It grew and my lip became a bit swollen, and now the skin where the bump appeared closes over half of the piercing back. And sometimes, when I try to push the piercing back through the skin, a thin white layer has formed over the back that tears when it is pushed through.There is no pussing, really, and it isn't really much redder or anything than the rest of my lip -- just this skin that is now halfway over my piercing back.

FAML	My 7 year old son is having major problems focusing	"My 7 year old son is having problems focusing in class.    He gets a healthy breakfast every morning and a good night sleep every night.    He just can't seem to block out his class mates and get his work done in a timely manner.    He is slow to start his projects and often does not complete them.    He also seems to block out much of what I ask and tell him to do when he is at home.    If I am speaking to him about video games or cartoons, he hears me clearly but everything else, I have to ask him 5 or more times in some cases. Our daily morning routine is always a struggle.    I have to remind him to do everything from brush his teeth to clean up after his breakfast dishes.    My husband and I have restricted his video gaming and television to weekends only and after chores.    This was done in order to teach him that he needs to focus on his responsibilities (ie, homework, chores, reading, etc).    On a recent Friday after school...he was so excited about being able to play video games while out with my husband that we waited too long to use the restroom and ended up peeing on himself at the Barber Shop and proceeded to cry about it like a baby.    I am sure that his tears were from embarrassment but he often cries after minor ""boo boos"".Because of his lack of focus, his grades are not where they should be.    We constantly work with him at home and also have arranged for a reading tutor a couple days after school.    I need to know if we should have him tested to find out if he has a learning disability and also how to help him mature and ""man up"" like other boys his age.    Please help!!"	remind|minor|order
DISE	Should I consider Surgery?	MRI April 2007. Showed L5/S1 bulging disc potrusion with chronic deformity on end plate of L5.    I had severe radiculopathy down both legs.    My Neurologist sent me for a series of 3 epidural injections, weeks after the 3rd injection i was total relief for about 3 months.    Now the radiculopathy is back worse in right leg, right foot is swollen on the out side and over the top of the foot.    Tibial and peroneal nerve is very sore.

TRMT	Issues after 2012 Flu Shot	Hi, I received the flu shot 8 days ago on 1/12 and it appears that since I got it I had adverse reactions.    I got a big headache, low fever about 99.5 and feeling of malaise the first night which is what I suppose is the normal reactions.    The next day I started to develop tingling in my fingers and toes which started to disturb me.    I also started to develop aches in my my thighs which became severe.    I went to my GP 2 days after the shot and he examined me and tested my arms/hands and legs strength through a series of motions and everything was fine.    He then had me do a series of blood labs.    That night my thighs really started to hurt so bad that I actually started to cry.    I took 2 advils and it eventually dulled it but they still ached.    The GP also referred me to a neurologist which I visited the next day and took the partial lab results which I had.    The neuro checked my reflexes and my arm/leg strength and said that everything looked fine.    I still felt weak and by this point my knees started to ache really bad along with my thighs and I also started to develop muscle twitches in my thighs, arms and sometimes back.    These are more annoying than painful.     My lab work showed everything normal and the neuro suggested that my body was mimicking having the flu even though the virus is suppose to be dead.    She said that there is no weakness so she doesn't see GBS and to rest my legs for 2 weeks and then come back for an EMG.    I should mention that 6 months earlier she did a baseline EMG for tingling I had in my fingers for possible carpal tunnel and I had no neuropathy.    I then saw my GP at the end of the week to get the rest of my results which would be yesterday 1/20.    Again he tested my strength in legs and arms and everything still looked good except that my legs and knees were still aching more so my knees and the pins and needles has subsided except for every once in a while. The thigh pain has started to subside and is more like an ache although I still have the twitching every once in a while.    The rest of the lab work showed that I now have a positive ANA of 1:80 that is speckled and nucleor.     The doctor referred me to a rheumologist which I have yet to see.    Yesterday my legs and knees felt better, they still hurt but not as much so I walked more.    I slept pretty well for the first time but this morning I woke up and felt like I didn't sleep and had a malaise type feeling which has since subsided.    Before the shot I have never had issues like this with my legs and knees and my ANA was always negative.    Is it possible that the vaccine triggered some auto immune issue?    I still worry about getting GBS, and every once in a while test my reflexes and strength just to keep my head straight especially since the neuro will not do an EMG until 1/29.    Any one have this reaction or have an idea of what could have happened and what could the ANA point to?    Everyone keeps saying to wait for at least 2 weeks as usually thats how long the flu takes to go away and today day 9 the aches has seemingly started to subside although they are still there but a lot less, although I am feeling an ache now in my hip area/joints. I mean I'm not crying as I was before.    What does everyone think?

GOAL	Severe Pain in the middle of my brain	Hello, I am 21 year old male.On a saturday night i ingested some mdma and marijuana. I was sitting in the backseat of my friends car in a very relaxed state. I started moving my tounge on the inside of my mouth around and around. After a while, I realised i wasn't even moving my tongue and just had felt it like an hallucination. About 5 seconds later, I felt like my soul was cracking out of my body and felt a severe stabbing pain on the middle of my brain that lasted about 2 seconds. I got up out of my seat and started screaming on the top of my lungs. I had no symptoms afterwards.What had happened? I understand that MDMA is an amphetamine which works on serotinergic and dopaminergic system which can cause vasconstriction. I also understand that marijuana can increase stroke volume. Is it possible i had a TIA?	stabbing pain|symptoms|tongue|severe|vasconstriction|stroke|TIA|brain|lungs|body

GOAL	How can I make an effort to change my diet?	"This is almost a repeat question of the one asking about how to eat healthy for cheaper..My step dad keeps a really tight budget on the food he buys. He always get food for convenience and never cooks for us kids (me and my two teenage brothers). He buys processed foods such as canned ravioli, frozen pizzas, bagels and cream cheese, pop-tarts, cereal. etc. And he buys the exact same things EVERY time he gets groceries and when I think about it, has been, for YEARS! I hate the way he does things because I would seriously like to eat healthier, but he does NOT like spending money. Even when he has it. He buys fast food very often, but only for himself and my mother. (How awful is that, right?) Anyways, do you think there is anyway I can convince him to buy some things that are better for me? Try to go easy on the vegetable suggestions, as I'm not a big fan, unfortunately. Are there any ides of just some simple, cheap-ish foods that aren't complete junk? I don't even know, when they ask me ""Well what kind of food??"" Because I don't go to the store with them, and when I do I always feel like they're hurrying me! I hate this. It's quite often anymore that after I eat I feel gross, from the inside, almost like puking.I know most of that has to do with what I'm eating and how unhealthy it usually is. I've wanted to be healthier for a long, long time now. And even more so since I just had a baby a month ago and I'm starting to put on a little bit more weight since I gave birth and am ready to start exercising. Everyone in my house has very unhealthy lifestyles and do not care to change it.. So it can't be anything too drastic.Any help/suggestions?"	weight|canned|right

SOCL	The solution i use for shaft and tip of penis stinging and pain	The solution i use to my issues with stinging in the penis after sex or masturbation is to try to keep myself hard after ejaculation. then to just use some cold water and pour it slowly into the hole at the head. i find this releives the stinging quickly and efficiently and i have had this problum since i became sexually active in any and all forms. i had this problum the first time i masturbated and the first time i had sex it was about 8 months ago i came across this method as after masturbating and the stinging kicked in. i felt the shaft and it was quite hot after putting it in a bit of cold water the stinging releived slightly. next time round i tryed pour some straight into the hole and it almost immediatly purged the pain. a mild discomfort remained but urinating is a fast way to releive this discomfort. I would suggest it is worth a try as it has helped me dramatically. i have only just decided to go online with solution when a friend started talking to me about his issues and i explained what i do and he also found this to help. well good luck if you decide to try it, and dont give up first try use diffrent temp water and i use cold my friend used room tempThis discussion is related toPeriodic tip of penis pain after ejaculation, burning.	discussion|penis pain|stinging|burning|pain|discomfort|penis|head

TRMT	abdominal pain 7 months post abdominal hysterectomy	I am 51 years old in good health.    I had a complete open abdominal hysterectomy in January.    I suffer terrible pain in my abdomen and burning in my upper groin and pain that starts at the left side and goes all across my abdomen.    I am on heavy duty pain killers, try to work and stay active.    My whole life has changed and no one can seem to help.    I am seeing a pain specialist and he has not helped.    All my test came out negative but I wonder if there may be a suture in there that did not dissolve. One of the doctors who did an ultrasound on me stated a suture can cause all this pain.    I am seeing a surgeon next week to see if maybe he can do some exploratory surgery.    Any advice.    I am scared to come out worse but I feel so awful all the time now that I can not imagine being worse.    The pain specialist wants to do some experimental things working with the nerves in my back and that scares me too.    Is there any chance at this stage that the pain would go away by itself.    It just seems to get worse.    Please help.	abdominal hysterectomy|ultrasound|suture|exploratory surgery|abdomen|groin|back|burning|pain|nerves|active
TRMT	Am I doing the right thing?	I will explain my problem first to give a better understanding to what is going on. Over the past 4 years I have had a reoccuring problem with bleeding during sex and very irregular bleeding. I have seen my gynecologist and GP for this problem. I have had many pap smears, ultrasounds, D&C and a hysteroscopy. They did find endometriosis but nothing more.I have had tests for Every STD and they are all negative and I have been tested for them many many times over the 4 years and they were all clear. My Husband and I have never cheated on eachother he also got tested for some things just incase it was something he had but everything also came back all clear.One thing my gynecologist and GP have told me that it could be related to the endometriosis, also through out the all the tests they did find I have von willebrand disease type 1 almost type 2 and thrombocytopenia which also could be a factor. I suffer from extreme pain from my period which comes every 2 weeks and lasts for 14 days. My period is very unpredictable and can last for up to 6 weeks. I also suffer pain from ovulation.I have had a merina put in but it hasn't done anything, I have had provera tablets, a nasal spray and some other things to try and stop all the bleeding but nothing has worked.Everyone is telling me that a hysterectomy is the best thing for this problem and my gyne and gp have agreed I am booked in on the 2nd of feb 2010 to have this done.Am I making the right choice ??? Will it stop the bleeding and all the pain I get?I know this means I can not have any more children and my husband and I have talked about this and we are ok with that.

GOAL	white 'stuff' around healing gum	hello,10 days ago i had a bone grafting in my upper incisor socket after tooth removal in preparation for the future implant. A dissolvable collagen membrane was placed as well to protect grafting material. Then the socket was stiched, a temporary maryland bridge placed to cover the gap, and gums looked nice and pink for a week. A few days ago i noticed some white stuff over the area where the gum was stitched. It looks like a plaque or some white sticky, fluffy tissue around my temp. tooth near gum line, but it does not cause any problems. it doesnt hurt, doesnt smell, and the gum around it is still pink. It is just looking strange. I tried to touch it with a q-tip but id doesnt want to detach that easily. What is it? Is it a normal healing process of the gum or is it a dead tissue or a scab? Im seeing my dentist next week, just wanted to be sure that it is not an urgent problem.thank you for your answer	bone grafting|tooth removal|grafting|implant|incisor|tooth|plaque|gums
DISE	No outbreak after 11 days	I am unsure if I have herpes 2.    I had unprotected sex 11 days ago.    Three days later, small trace of blood comes from tip of penis. I am sure this was caused by 'rough' sex (it has happened before).    After day three, I begin examining my penis daily.Day 4-7: I notice I have 'jock itch' type symptoms of mild itch and burn between my balls and leg.    Baby powder mostly clears this up but a slightly red coloration remains.    I also believe this may have been caused by washing my clothes in a public shower (I am traveling at the moment).Day 8: No flu symptoms, no lesions buy the tip of my penis doesn't appear normal.    It looks disfigured at the tip.Day 11: Very small white area on tip of penis is noticed and flu symptoms are present (cough, runny nose, no fever).    My appetite is lower than usual, but this might be caused by stress over the situation.Does this sound like I have herpes?    I would like to get tested but fear it is too soon for a blood test.    In addition, there is no 'outbreak' to visually inspect or take a swab test.	flu symptoms|jock itch|herpes 2|herpes|penis|runny nose|symptoms|leg|trace

I called her on Monday asking her out on Tue or Wed and she told me that she would work though she is free on Fri; told her that we should call eachother during the week to fix the details. I called her today (Wed) though she did not answer the phone.Should I try again tomorrow? I mentioned during the call that i lied to my boss so I went home earlier. Is this a thing to think?Do I do something wrong? I get the same behaviour from some girls. Or, on the other hand, the girls are so easy I am getting bored... When i get resistent I have anxiety, when get it not i am bored...Is there something I should do so that I get a propper relationship? Am I loser?Thanks,Sun	hand

SOCL	Ten Huge Issues Being Ignored in the Presidential Campaign	The media focus on political minutiae in the presidential campaign can often crowd out the substantive issues that the winner will have to deal with once taking office. And while the candidates themselves occasionally talk about these issues, thereÃ¢ € ™s a number of critical concerns that get no attention, including some of the worst problems (in terms of the harm they cause to peopleÃ¢ € ™s lives) in the United States and the world. To address this lamentable state of affairs, ThinkProgress has compiled a list of eight of the most significant problems being severely underserved by the campaign and American political discourse more broadly. In no particular order:MASS INCARCERATION AND THE DRUG WARWriting in the New Yorker, Adam Gopnik termed Ã¢ € œmass incarceration on a scale almost unexampled in human historyÃ¢ € ¦perhaps the fundamental fact [of American society], as slavery was the fundamental fact of 1850.Ã¢ €  Indeed, as Gopnik notes, there are more black men are in prison today than were enslaved then and more total people in prison than there were in StalinÃ¢ € ™s gulags at their largest. The result of this wave of imprisonment was structural inequality so severe that it was called Ã¢ € œthe new Jim CrowÃ¢ €  by a famous book of the same title, as the strict limitations placed on convicted felons have rendered millions black Americans second-class citizens. One of the principal causes of the rise of mass incarceration is the War on Drugs, which has failed abysmally at limiting the use of dangerous drugs but succeeded wildly at aiding and abetting racial inequality in the United States and the murderous drug trade abroad. The Justice Department recently doubled down on these policies by initiating a massive crackdown on medical marijuana in states that have legalized the drugÃ¢ € ™s medicinal use.THE HOUSING MARKETThough itÃ¢ € ™s well-known that the housing bubble collapse precipitated the financial collapse, the subsequent woes of the housing market have received comparatively little attention. John Griffith, Julia Gordon, and David Sanchez, in a recent report for the Center for American Progress, call the current housing market Ã¢ € œone of the biggest drags on our recovery,Ã¢ €  writing that Ã¢ € œThe historic decline in home prices since 2006 has cost Americans more than $7 trillion in household wealth, forced millions of families out of their homes, and left nearly one in four homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Private investment in housing is a fraction of its historic norm, translating to billions in lost economic output and millions of missing jobs. And more than five years into the crisis, the U.S. mortgage market remains on life support as the federal government guaranteed more than 95 percent of home loans made last year.Ã¢ € THE INDIA/PAKISTAN CONFLICTNationofChange fights back with one simple but powerful weapon: the truth. Can you donate $5 to help us?As the United States exits Afghanistan, tensions are likely to flare up again between the two nuclear-armed states over concerns about terrorism and relative influence in the country. The status of the contested Jammu-Kashmir province also remains unresolved. Former Pakistani director of Arms Control and Disarmament Affairs, Feroz Hassan Khan, concluded in a paper published by the US Army War College that Ã¢ € œthis region seems to be the one place in the world most likely to suffer nuclear warfare due to the seemingly undiminished national, religious, and ethnic animosities between these two countries.Ã¢ € OVERFISHINGFish stocks have been in free-fall since 1989, and the reason for that is clear: humans are killing fish so quickly that Ã¢ € œlarge ocean fishÃ¢ €  stocks have been reduced to ten percent of their pre-industrial peak. This pace, which could destroy every fishery in the world by 2048, isnÃ¢ € ™t just of interest to animal rights activists, as the fishing industry plays a critical role in both feeding the worldÃ¢ € ™s poor and the American economy. Marine ecologist Daniel Pauly goes further, worrying that the effects of the Ã¢ € œend of fishÃ¢ €  on the ocean ecosystem could imperil its stability altogether, undermining one of the central bases of life on earth.INTERNET PRIVACYWe routinely put our vital information online without thinking, but itÃ¢ € ™s becoming increasingly unclear that such information is protected from government and corporate spying. As products like Facebook become essential services, tech companies are employing shady privacy and security procedures that make it very easy for data to be leaked to third-party sources without your consent. Moreover, FBI and similar government agents can gain access to private electronic information through national security surveillance powers.AMERICAÃ¢ € ™S SECURITY STATE AND SHADOW WARSThough Guantanamo Bay, the PATRIOT Act, and warrantless wiretapping were thought to be vestiges of the Bush Administration in 2009, the Obama Administration hasnÃ¢ € ™t rolled them back, threatening to make the supposedly emergency-only national security state a permanent institution. In recent years, the the security state at home has been supplemented by an escalating shadow war against terrorist organizations in several countries around the world, waged principally by Special Forces and a secretive drone program. These stepped-up counterterrorism policies may be weakening al-Qaeda and associated movements, but itÃ¢ € ™s not clear if the potential costs in terms of privacy violations, blowback, and deaths of innocent civilians are well understood, let alone worth it.FACTORY FARMINGSeveral billion animals live and get killed on factory farms, concentrated animal-raising plants where sentient creatures are forced to live their entire lives in tiny, often poorly maintained pens. The treatment of the pigs, cows, and chickens on factory farms is horrific Ã¢ € ” the pens are so tight that animals develop sores, the stress of confinement produces psychiatric disorders that result in self-harming behaviors like gnawing on metal bars, and proprietors conduct painful, medically unnecessary tail amputations simply because they want to. Factory farming also hurts humans; the Ã¢ € œfarmsÃ¢ €  are ideal breeding grounds for infectious diseases and do serious damage to the local and global environment.SEGREGATION BY RACE AND CLASS IN EDUCATIONDespite Brown v. Board of Education, there is a pronounced trend toward resegregation by race and class in American schools. Poor students, especially black and Latino ones, are being shunted into a separate-but-unequal school system while wealthy students attend parallel, superior institutions. The effect of this, as Chris Hayes documents in his book Twilight of the Elites, is to create a self-perpetuating class cycle where the wealthy use their advantage to secure that their children get access to the best possible schooling, making it significantly easier for said children to become wealthy and successful and do the same for their kids. The less well off, by contrast, have only very limited ability to break into the upper echelons of American society through education, helping to cement broader trends toward inequality in the United States.http://www.nationofchange.org/ten-huge-issues-being-ignored-presidential-campaign-1348067863	life support|amputations|treatment|shunted|Drugs|procedures|severe|disorders|diseases|Brown|said|infectious|painful|harming|back|Arms|order|tail|rights|contrast

DISE	Inflammation on my knee	"Hi! I'm 15 years old boy. Everything was normal until I rubbed my knee against quite sharp edge (obtuse, but still quite sharp). Now there's inflammation on my knee. It came over a day. It's like big bump, a bit red and it's hot. It's tough also. Doctor told me that there's no ""water on the knee"", because there's no pus inside and it's weirdly tough. Also she told me that knee is soft or something like that (whatever is normal, was it soft or hard, but everything is okay with joint). She told me to stay home and let my leg relax. Also I put a camomile compress onto this bump. It worked. In the morning (today, 12.10.09) it wasn't hot anymore and it was soft and quite small. Now I visited doctor and when I came home, it was still small, but it was hot and tough again. It was due to walking.What should I do, to get rid of it? Or should i keep using camomile compress and just wait longer?I uploaded some pictures.http://img394.imageshack.us/img394/1635/stp81932.jpghttp://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5912/stp81934.jpgThanks in advance, Rasmus."	knee|leg|'s inflammation
PREG	Update	I just thought I would let you all know whats been going on besides of me being so busy.As some of you allready know, I started Spotting on 7 DPO and AF was late around 18DPO and negative test. Well really horrible AF CD 10 was still spotting so I called the RE. Went in yesterday and he said everything looked ok, but he did ask me if I had a positive test and I told him no. But when they did the u.s he said I had some follies on both sides this time nothing to measure yet but they should be around Sat. I am not doing a trigger this cycle so I am hoping that I ovulate on my own. He is finally going to do a progesterone test around CD 24 to see if I do ovulate if not and AF arrives around the 17th then he is uping the clomid to 150 mg. He is hoping that I ovulate on my own and this is the month. I thought I would update you all. I don't know how much I will be own the cpu this cycle since we are getting our home refinanced with interests rates so low and we are planning my brothers wedding. But I will let you know about the progesterone test. Thanks to all of you and SSBD to you all!!Hugs :o)	said
PREG	After MC, have not had a cycle yet.	Hi everyone.    I'm kind of new to this. And maybe someone can help me with this. My husband and I have been ttc for 4 years now and got pregnant with the help of IVF in Sept. On Oct 23 I had a miscarriage at 5 weeks and bleed for about 1 week.    My hcg levels have dropped to 0 and I still haven't had a true cycle after the m/c.    My doctor has put me on progesterone for 10 days and said my cycle should start after that.    Has anyone had this problem and conceived after cycle came?    Another question I have, I had been looking at websites dealing with Ovulex & Amberoz. Has anyone and their spouses taken these to help them get pregnant? And I also heard that Geritol Complete is good also. Is this true? I've been ready to start trying again.	said
GOAL	4 year old newly diagnosed with severe farsightedness	Hi. My son was recently diagnosed with farsightedness - +6.00 in left eye and +6.75 in right eye. I'm wondering if I can trust the accuracy of this diagnosis. He doesn't have any problems with fine motor skills or seeing things I point out to him. I had no idea he was having trouble seeing until this past summer when his eyes seemed to cross now and then ( which is why I took him to the optometrist). I asked the optometrist about this when they said he needed glasses and she told me that since he's always seen poorly he wouldn't know any different and therefor wouldn't complain. He wears his glasses without a fight and when they slip down on his nose he tilts his head back so he can look through the glasses rather than look over them.... so I guess they help some at least. He does complain that he can't see when he has a patch on his good eye. When I first put it on he held my hand and wouldn't let go - like he was scared. (sorry for rambling) I'm so new at this. I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions so I can better understand what's happening with my son. Any info is appreciated.

DISE	RCL Thumb	"I injured my RCL in my thumb and my ortho did an xray and found lax(tear, I would guess). He recommended I be in cast for 8 weeks for the ligament to heal. he mentioned i still may need surgery after the 8 weeks. I am an very active in sports and I am a network engineer 'heavy typing-computer user"", so being casted or without the use of my hand for 8+ weeks is a problem. Also, the I am right handed which is the hand with the cast. I understand it takes time to heal and physio, but I need to look at the treatment that will take the least mount of time. I don't want to be in a cast for 8 weeks, waiting for it to ""possibly"" heal. Then find out I still need surgery and be in a cast for another 8 weeks.Should I go ahead and insist on surgery?What percentage do I have that it will heal on its own compared to having surgery?I just don't want to be a casualty of saving money for the hospital by providing the cheapest treatment."	right handed|thumb|hand|ligament|treatment|active
GOAL	Worried About Focus Problem	Hello~What would cause difficulty focusing the eyes mainly in the morning? Especially when I look at my digital alarm clock - my eyes will go in and out of focus. I have looked through past posts and can't really find much that relates to this topic. I just had an eye exam a month and a half ago. I am myopic -5.50/-5.00 and have an astigmatism. I have an appointment scheduled with my opthalmologist but in the meantime, does anyone have any ideas? I am worried about a brain tumor or MS.I posted a few times regarding this topic about having trouble focusing. I have figured out that it's not my glasses. I thought that my glasses might have been straining my eyes but this is not the case. I wore my old glasses for a week and still had the trouble.Thanks so much for reading.	astigmatism|eye exam|brain|eyes

SOCL	Mislead by the ex-boyfriend and crushed...what to do?	"A little backup history:I broke up with my boyfriend about a month and a half ago for various reasons (we had been together for a year and a half I'm 22 he's 23) and throughout that time we kept up communication, mostly through phone calls and text messages. He was upset about the breakup and wanted me back at the beginning but I just wasn't sure that he would start to make time for me and listen to my needs and what was important to me, so I told him that I loved him but that we were at different points in our lives and that we should cut all communication. I had also moved out of his house and moved back home 4 hours away, so it would be much more difficult to maintain our relationship.Of course, he said that it would be too hard to stop contact with me since he still loved me so much, so I unfortunately kept talking to him. He would text me and tell me about his day and wish me goodnight frequently, and also mention that he loved me. So anyway, this past weekend was my birthday and after mentioning my desire to see him, he actually drove up 4 hours to spend time with me.I thought it would be a great weekend and it was, HOWEVER he started acting like my boyfriend. Not only did he try to sleep with me (as all men do) but even after I had denied him the first time, he would continue to hold my hand, kiss me, cuddle with me, and tell me he loved me and missed me. He also spent lots of money on a birthday dinner and drinks... about $300 the entire weekend on me. He acted like the perfect gentleman and the guy that I had fallen in love with the first time. In addition, when people on the street asked if I was his girlfriend, he said yes and that we were celebrating my birthday.The entire weekend with him felt so right and reminiscent of our first few months together as a couple and when he left I burst into tears. When he arrived home he told me what a great weekend he had and that he loved me. So, imagine my surprise when I called him later that night asked him how he felt about us trying to be together long distance. The response I got was ""I dont know...."" I was SO CONFUSED. The entire weekend he acted like my boyfriend, drove up 4 hrs each way to be with me for my birthday, and had wanted us to get back together when we first broke up and now he wanted absolutely NO COMMITMENT? Why on earth was he so affectionate then? And why did he take the time and the money to see a girl, he was no longer interested in having as a girlfriend?After a few days, I just let it go. But he still kept texting me at night to tell me about his day and to say goodnight. One night it was even ""Goodnight Love."" I finally contacted him on the third day and told him how much it had hurt for him to mislead me like that. All he said was that he was sorry and that he still cared a lot for me and how seeing me brought back a surge of emotions that he ""could not control.""Now I am SO ANGRY! How could he have done this to me? I feel like he filled my heart with so much joy and love only to step on it a few days later. I snapped at him and asked him how he could blatantly ignore how his misleading behavior would affect me and that I had feelings too! But all he said was that he knew I had feelings for him and that he had feelings for me too. Funny how the ""I love you's"" quickly turned into ""feelings"" for him.I feel SO USED, especially since I did end up sleeping with him. How can someone tell you that they love you one day and the next refuse to establish any sort of commitment when they display such strong behavior to the contrary? Is it just me or is this guy, the biggest jerk ever? What kind of advice can you give me?    Should I appreciate him for being with me on my birthday or cut him out of my life completely for being so selfish?"	heart|hand|cut|lot|back|said|right

TRMT	Endometriomas	I have had severe pelvic pain for years and had a partial hysterectamy 3 yrs ago. I had an internal and external ultrasound. My Dr. did another internal ultrasound so she could see the cyst on my left ovary for herself. She is telling me that it could be an endometrioma. I don't understand how I can have this when I have no uteris. I can not find much info. on endometriomas either. I also have bladder, bowel, bloating, stomach, leg and hip, and back pain. I would like to know whether Lupron shots or removal would be wiser? I am worried about it being Cancer and tend to think I should just remove it.	and back pain|ultrasound|removal|severe|partial hysterectamy|left ovary|bladder|stomach|bowel|leg|hip|cyst|external
FAML	Silent treatment	"Our son in 3, nearly 31/2 and has gone to an in-home daycare for the last year (previously in a large daycare setting). Things have gone well up until the last 3-4 weeks. During the summer, my son was at the daycare with 2 other children - one who is his buddy (2, nearly 3 years old) and a 7-9 month old. The two other children are the daycare provider's (we'll call her Ms. A) grandchildren. So, obviously the 3 kids got more attention and were able to do fun things during the summer time that are not regular occurences during the school year w/ more kids.In mid-August, all the kids (5 total) returned (mostly 5 days/week). Our son was familiar with all of these kids, with the exception of one 2 year old boy, who started coming slightly after the problems (not yet discussed) arose.Our son is now the oldest child in the group. He is potty trained and has been for several months. When we previoulsy had problems, they were more evident at home (w/ potty training) vs. at daycare. He rarely had accidents at either place.However, our son started basically not communicating with Ms.A. He won't tell her if he needs to go to the bathroom, and has had numerous accidents (which seem intentional at times, to avoid speaking to her). And he is now opting to not be able to do activities with the other children, including free time to play, because he refuses to ask for whatever he needs to (Ms.A has tried to promote communication by requiring that he ask to do things now). He also has nearly been OCD re: having his shoes tied and laying a certain way and now he is opting to go with them untied, because he is refusing to ask for help.This is only happening at daycare and only in the last 3-4 weeks. He had no trouble communicating these things prior to this time. In addition, he is talking very normally at home. Communicating fine and without any trouble or difference.We have asked him countless times why he refuses to talk to Ms.A, (whom he is very fond of). And he isn't able to really give any real answer, no matter how we ask.We are now taking away priveleges at home, including not getting any ""treats"" and now we are moving onto eliminating his t.v. privledge until he begins to communicate with Ms. A.We really feel that Ms.A provides a positive environment for the children - in which we'd like him to be engaged. Ms.A. has a background in education, esp. w/ pre-schoolers.We strongly believe that our son's behavior is rooted in seeking attention from Ms.A, but we are at a loss for how to promote communication and interaction again. The things that Ms.A. has tried and we've tried to this point have not made a difference.We are starting to contemplate taking him out of the small daycare setting, but fear the problem may be the same or worse in a larger daycare setting. However, we want him to be adequately prepared for preschool/school (and many more children that will be demanding the teacher's attention).If you have any suggestions, we would be so grateful to hear them."	demanding|one 2
PREG	Well ladies...looks like I'm gonna be officially out of the game for good (a...	"Looks like I'm finally gonna kick my good for nothin uterus to the curb!    I'm pretty devastated and I don't know where to begin.It has been just over 6 months since my second lap for endometriosis.    I also have adenomyosis, where the endometrial tissue grows through the muscular wall of the uterus, as well as PCOS, and Asherman's Syndrome - where I develop scar tissue on the inside of my uterus.They found the scar tissue on the last lap/hysteroscopy/d & c.    Well, since my IVF in March, where I had the positive HPT and then had a beta that showed there probably HAD been something but it was on it's way out.... I barely bled.    So much (or so little) so that I went back to my dip$hit OBGYN a week later and had him retest.    I was also already having pain then.    Oh and when I went back to him, he kept asking me, ""how many EGGS did they put in you?"" and I KEPT correcting him - ""they're EMBRYOS, not eggs"" - and he KEPT saying it!!!!    This guy actually performs IUI's!    So I decided then and there that I can't believe I ever let him operate on me and I was never going back.    Plus, everything I read about Asherman's says you need someone with experience to remove the scar tissue - my guy had ""never seen it before"" and was ""baffled!"" but removed it anyway.So in March I just spotted, and then in April (almost 4 wks later) I started getting af cramps and was certain it was coming.    I went to the bathroom and was spotting from the front, but ALSO spotting from the back!    This was very upsetting because it is the third time I've witnessed this but finally confirmed it.    The first two times I was bleeding heavier and had hoped that maybe it was just blood from the front that migrated back there.    This time there was no mistaking because I was only spotting - and very DEFINITELY from both ends.    This means the endo has migrated somewhere in my colon, rectum or who knows.In addition, I continued to only barely spot for two days.    Then the spotting from both ends subsided and my cramps stopped as if my period was over, but I hadn't really bled.    This could mean that my scar tissue is back and obstructing my cervix.    So I began to do what I could to see the Asherman's specialist who luckily happens to work at my fertility place.    It has been tricky w/the insurance, but I knew people I spoke to didn't know what they were talking about (they insisted they HAD to put infertility on my diagnosis which would mean ins wouldn't pay) - but I had them schedule me anyway.    Sure enough, the doctor today was like ""I don't have to put it and I'm not going to"" -so I know they'll pay.I made them see me quickly because since my last ""period"" I have been in more and more pain.    Once again I can barely lead my life.    I have had to leave work twice in the past week in tears from my pain.    I went in there today thinking that if I just could find someone that knew what they were doing they could help fix me to have a baby.    I even was thinking I could get ovarian drilling done while they were inside of me, to fix my PCOS temporarily and hopefully make me ovulate on my OWN for a couple of months so we could try the old fashioned way and have a better shot.WOW!    I got a major B itch slapping!!!    Basically he said he'd do the lap if I really wanted, but didn't think it would give me relief for more than a couple of months.    First, I have to get a colonoscopy done to confirm the endo in my colon.    If they find it (which he is pretty sure they will) they will have to remove part of it and resection it.    Awesome.    I was prepared for that part and knew that was coming.    Then he said we should repeat my HSG to check if my cervix is indeed blocked or not.    After that I get to decide...have another useless lap or get rid of my good for nothing, piece of $hit uterus all together!He thinks my pain is from the adenomyosis (where it grows through the muscular wall) - the only cure for which is a hysterectomy.    He said I could TRY lupron, and induce menopause for six months, and that MAY shrink it and help relieve SOME of my pain, but there's no guarantee and once I'm off it again it will come back.    So what's the point??    Just so I can give menopause a try and see how fun it is?    WTF???    I'd still be in the same boat when all is said and done.I also asked about the ovarian drilling, and he said for a patient with pain he would definitely NOT recommend it.    It will cause scarring on my ovaries and probably more pain.    No sense having them ultimately take my uterus to relieve pain and do something beforehand to my ovaries that will continue to cause me pain.    I would like to keep at least one so I don't have to take awful hormones for the next 30 years!Now I was so stunned I did NOT ask him what he thought my chances of conceiving actually were.    Like if I did have the lap and gave it another shot....    But he does work in my RE's office and knows I've been coming there, so I have a feeling if he thought I had a legitimate shot that he may have included an option involving trying to conceive - not just induced menopause or hysterectomy!I have been pretty destroyed today.    I don't know what to do.    If I have another lap and try again - where does it end?    How long do I suffer through this?    I can't lead a normal life anymore - can't hold down a job, always in pain...    At some point I will have to come to terms with this.    And if I TTC again and it doesn't work?    Then it will be even MORE devastating knowing it was the last and final try.    I just don't know - I keep going back and forth.    If I have surgery again it will be my third in a year and a half, with fertility treatments in between.    I just don't know what to do.    I'm not sure I'm strong enough to handle this.At first I scoffed at the thought of a surrogate mom, because my eggs are great and that's about the only thing I've got going for me!    But now I'm really thinking about it (especially since the nurse gave me a brochure today when I was crying in the office).    I feel TERRIBLY selfish even considering it - I always thought it was an awful thing to consider when there were so many children who need homes.    But now that I'm faced with losing my uterus at 33 before having a baby of my own, somehow I feel like it may be the only way I could actually cope with this situation.    Somehow still having a child that was from me and my husband in the end seems like it may help me to heal.    To be able to look into those eyes that I'd always dreamed about.    I feel like it would be different if I wasn't losing it.    I would be OK with adopting.    But somehow this changes things for me.    I am so sad.    I don't know what to do.    Oh and did I mention that my husband is away in NJ for two weeks so I'm here alone and have no friends here where we live?    Good times..."

FAML	In need of support and advice	Hi everyone.    This is my first time posting and I feel so lost and feel like I have nobody that understands me.    I have been married for 12 years and have 2 children.    My husband is an alcoholic and has finally admitted that.    About 7 years ago he received his first OUI and last year he received his second.    I have stood by him through it all but am at the end of my rope now.    I am sick of making excuses for him, for covering up his behavior and of being scared of leaving the kids with him when I go to work at night.    He is the son of a drunk (and I say that because my father in law will never admit he has a problem) and has several siblings that have drinking problems as well.    The big problem that I have is that he comes from a culture where that is the norm.     None of his family think he has a problem, yet they all live 3000 miles away in another country and don't see what he is doing to us, plus half of them have their own problems.    My own family all moved out of state about 5 years ago which leaves me no support except one good friend who has her own issues to deal with.    Plus my own family just call him a drunk and tell me I should leave him and move up with them, which I can't because I can't move my kids out of state without his permission, it is considered kidnapping, plus I do love him.    My husband was court ordered into a 14 day intreatment program that all people who are found guilty of a second OUI must go to.    I was praying that it would do him some good.    He was released last Sunday and I thought I had a new husband.    While he was there he quit smoking and said he was all done drinking and was an alcoholic as well and that he realized what he was doing and how it was affecting us.    He said he was going to go to AA meetings and start going to church again and turn his life around.    Well, for 6 days everything was great, however, no AA meetings.    Yesterday he decided to go and hang out at the club he belongs to with his friends.    They do alot of drinking at this club but he assured me that he would not be.    I know that I can not be everywhere he goes (plus I had to work) and that he has to make his own choices and only he can keep the beer out of his hand.    He called me at work after he got home and told me that he had two beers at the club and that he felt awful about it and he never should have done it.    My heart dropped because I was so disappointed that he couldn't last a week out of rehab, yet I was encouraging and said that it happens and it was only 2 beers and that he was honest with me and admits his mistake and that we would go to an AA meeting together asap and get back on track.    Then when I got home we had another talk but I couldn't sleep all night because I keep thinking that he wasn't going to be able to do it and that things were going to go right back to how they were because I have no faith in him.    Then this morning the kids came up to me and said that daddy was drinking again (and they are 6 and 8 years old, they shouldn't have to be doing that).    I said I knew and that he only had 2 beers.    They said he only had 2 beers are the club (which they said he tried to refuse at first but the guys kept pushing him till he took one)    but on the way home he made the guy who was driving him stop to pick up a six pack.    When I asked him about that he said he did but was afraid I would get mad, and he told me that he gave most of the beers to his friends and only had 2 but the kids said he drank all 6.    Today he is at a BBQ with all those guys again.    I was begging him not to go, but he assured me he was not going to drink, but I just don't believe him.    I don't think he is strong enough at this point to be around others who he has always drank with and not have a drink.    I just don't know what to do.    He said he is going to go the the AA meeting I found for him tomorrow night.    I want to go to an Al Anon meeting but I looked them up and they have so few of them and I work to jobs and have kids to take care of.    The only ones that are anywhere near me that are at times I am not working are times I have the kids and I don't think it is a good idea to bring them and I have nobody to watch them for me.    I am so lost and alone and ashamed and scared and I just need some support, please and some advice.	heart|hand|Today|said|back|right

PREG	PLEASE any tips to increase fertility/chances of conception after loss . . .	"Hello :)I had a missed miscarriage (my first preg) with D&C on 121208.    I am now in the throws of my 2nd cycle since the procedure - I didn't miss periods AT ALL!I am sad and depressed to get my period but not cripplingly so.    I'm sure there are plenty of those who can commiserate.I am ovulating (per OPK's) at day 21 of my cycle, this has been the case in my last 2 cycles since the D&C and prior to my pregnancy (LMP for that was 092108).    My OB suggests ""keep tryin"" - which we are and have been since Sept. 2007.    I am 27 ultra healthy and my DH is 29, healthy but smokes (not around me - or else!).In following my doctors suggestion I would like to ""keep trying"" but I want to hedge my bets.    Is there anything that anyone could suggest?    Natural is best for me, I'm a yoga instructor and live cleanly.Also, if you would take a look at my activity - I would appreciate it.    Again, my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage so any info is soooooooooooooooo appreciated!Moderate intensity cardio 6-7 days 40-60 mins (pretty soaked when I'm done: running, biking, circuits, HIIT, a variety)Strength training 2-3 days 30-40 minsYoga 5-6 times a week (although this is something my body is pretty used to by now)I am a recovering vegan, but I still am not too hot about meat.    I don't eat red meat or pork.    No junk to speak of.Okay, thank you in advance!"	missed miscarriage|pregnancy|procedure|soaked|yoga|body
GOAL	Please help 13yr old son	Hi, Everyone I would like to give you a little info about me. I am 40 years old man and have been exercising (weight training) since I was 16.    I am also a divorced father so my legal rights to my children are more difficult to exercise since my ex-wife is the custodial parent.    My concern is for my 13 year old son. Here is the situation: the ex hired a personal trainer for him and this guy is one of those guys who is extreme, however the ex feels that itÃ¢ € ™s good to push my son to his limits (remember heÃ¢ € ™s only 13). Here is a little info on what I have found out on the trainer he claims he is certified USAW sports performance coach (being in gyms my whole adult life, I here this guy is a compulsive liar, so he might not even attended this certification). After looking this up to be USAW certified is only a 3 day training. He also claims he is USATF coach, this is a ridiculous online training to be a personal trainer.Here is what he has my 13yr old son doing powerliftingÃ¢ € ¦ deadlifting 250+ lbs. the sled dragging a lot of weight until he vomits.    There are other ridiculous exercises he has him do, however I want to concentrate on my current situation hereÃ¢ € ™s what happened: he had my son deadlift over 250+ lbs and immediately after had him doing jump exercise to a box which is at least 2-3ft of the ground. My son injured his patella tendon, doc says it ripped off the knee and took a piece of bone with it.    Now he needs to have surgery this Monday.I have tried for many months to explain to the ex this is not right, oh yea she also has him train in ju-jitsu right after weight training.    We have even discussed this with attorneys and the court claims children need to be in activities and sports.My question is this, is there anything medically that I can claim or prove that this not healthy for my son (not to mention other kids heÃ¢ € ™s training). From what I know with the years I have exercised and been around others who are trainers is this, he still has not developed his growth plates yet, not to mention pushing that kind of weight can injure interior organs at his age if not done correctly. He is not old enough to make the decision on this kind of exercise regimen, however I know him he doesnÃ¢ € ™t want to disappoint his mom.Please any kind of help would be greatly appreciated.	growth plates|patella|tendon|organs|knee|bone|lot|exercises|regimen|exercised|weight|vomits|rights|right|interior
DISE	Opana to Subs to Opana god will it ever stop?!?!?!	Ok I tried to quit in October, made it a while then ended up doing the same stupid S**T like always.    So then I got to buying Subs off a friend mostly to stay well and save money.    Now I'm engaged to my 10 year old son's mother (havent been together in 8 years), going to start to build our home this year, and have work and school all going on, on top of that.    I went 3 days without Subs last week, didnt feel to bad at all other then no sleep/fatigue.    I did some Opana 1 day then went & did 1mg of Subs for two days, and of course found Opanas for cheap today so I did 80mg. Stupid a$$ I know.    I'm off work the next 7 days though.    I have given my debit card, all cash, and car keys to my fiancee'. I'm about to go through hell I know but I know it will be worth it if I can succeed.    I have NO SUBS OR OPANA left.    Question is if I wasnt feeling that bad 3 days ago is that what I should expect? I dont know how physically addicted to the Subs my body really is seeing I have taken them a few days straight then back to dope then back to Subs for about 3 months now.    I have never taken over 4mg a day though, just enough not to be sick.    Should I just expect the same hell I have always went through or since it wasnt that bad last week on my trial run am I just going to get lucky and not sleep a week or two.    I know the half life of Subs is like 37 hours so I went the 3 days to just see how it felt and honestly wasnt that bad, IDK I'm sorry for rambling but I need advice and I need help. Other then my fiancee NO ONE KNOWS who and what I really am.    I'm a functioning junkie and I hate myself more and more everyday when I look at my beautiful 10 year old gift from god.    I have started back with church, I have been praying so hard for the will power and strength to say NO FOR GOOD, I'm just scared that I will fail once again.    This visicous cycle is making me so depressed, so depressed on christmas day I left my son and his momma with her family drove to a state park forestry, cried like a little b***h for a cpl hours wanting to just give up and die.    I have NEVER even thought of suicide in all of my 31 years of life.    I hate this, I hate what I have become, I am so afraid of failing, loosing this fantastic job, not being able to put a roof over my family's head and just giving up and ending it all.

SOCL	Gratitude for the Mundane	http://ramblingtaoist.blogspot.com/2010/02/195-gratitude-for-mundane.htmlBeing spiritual means not taking things for granted. Quite the opposite, you remember how everything that comes to you fits into an overall scheme. You acknowledge the precious quality of everyday things. And you maintain a gratitude for both the good and the bad in your life.~ from 365 Tao: Daily Meditations, Entry 195 ~Let's face it. People love to be wowed. This is one of the great pulls of religion; that opportunity to have grand epiphanies and be part of celestial extravaganzas. We crave to see the burning bush or to hear God's voice booming from the clouds.What gets lost in the shuffle, however, is the mysterious wonder of the mundane. Every moment we are conscious, each aspect of our lives is a spectacle to behold. The air that we breath. The food that nourishes us. The robin's song we listen to. The sun that shines on us. The emptiness we feel in solitude.We don't need to go to church or a special place to feel connected to the infinite. We don't need to fall down on our knees in prayer or take time out of our day to meditate. Heck, we don't have to do anything but be aware and, when we allow ourselves to be aware, all things are connected.	burning|fits|knees|face|Tao|aspect|overall

TRMT	Tram Flap Complications	I was born with Poland Syndrome (muscle missing in my right breast) in 1999 I had a tram flap surgery, after surgery the inside corner of my breast would not heal due to fat nacrosis the doctor removed the tissue that would not heal due to the fact that there was not enough blood supply getting to that area.    Nine (9) years later I end up with a puss pocket in the same area that was removed, it was 12cm x 12cm.    In three (3) months it shrunk down to 6cm x 6cm and then nothing.The original doctor will not help me and the doctors that I am going to now will not respond when I ask them if this is due to the tram flap.    No one will admit that the tram flap is the cause of this problem.    So I am stuck with an open wound in my right breast.    Can having an open wound in my breast cause cancer?

FAML	out of control child	Hi, I am having a very difficult time managing my 3.8 yrs old boy. He is a sensitive, shy and highly demanding child. I am having a super difficult time with him, heÃ‚ ´s got terrible tantrums, wants to have everything his way, is rude with peers and parents alike. Tantrums include hitting his parents and calling us stupid.    HeÃ‚ ´s always been shy, since heÃ‚ ´s little and had a very difficult time adapting to school. Up to this day weÃ‚ ´re dealing with separation anxiety issues. At home he doesnÃ‚ ´t stay still, he runs around the house and enjoys playing with things like hoses and fountain-like objects. HeÃ‚ ´s got me completely exhausted (cause heÃ‚ ´s having trouble sleeping also) and his anxety and defiance are ruling our day to day lives. What hurts me the most is his inadaptability in new environments and situations.He had a new baby sister 4 months ago and tries to hurt her physically every time heÃ‚ ´s around her. Troubles include refusing food too. A voice inside of me is crying in anguish desperately seeking for help. What can I do? How should I manage? What should my responses be to all of his tantrums, his hitting, his anxiety and rudeness?	demanding|exhausted

GOAL	Bacterial Conjunctivitis or Dry Eyes?	Hi there!I've been having trouble with what I thought was bacterial conjunctivitis for the past 6 months.    Two doctors had said it was bacterial and gave me eye drops, and it went away, but it always came back a few weeks later.    I did throw away all make up, wash sheets, pillows, etc.    Most recently, when I used the eyedrops it would go away but come back within 24-48 hours of going off the medication so I ended up being on the eyedrops (Gentamycin) for 20 days.     My eyes were sore and gritty and I figured it was from the antibiotics, so I went to see an opthomologist for advice.    He said my eyes were perfectly healthy and that likely it was allergic pink eye, or dry eyes, and he gave me over the counter rewetting drops.    None of my family members had gotten pink eye in all this time so I figured he might be right, even though my eyes would turn bright red, swell up, they didn't itch, and they had the nasty yellow goop that is a good sign of bacteria.    The opthomologist sort of treated me like I was nuts because I wasn't CURRENTLY having an infection (obviously, because I was on antibiotics), so I just went on my way.Of course, 48 hours or so after going off, again, I started having pain and redness with my eye, and some discharge.    This time I used the rewetting drops and allergy eye drops and it seems to sort of help.    My eyes haven't been red, but I have woken up with my eyes crusting shut and a lot of clear discharge as well.    They don't bother me much during the day but more at night. I figured they might have been right.. perhaps allergies since the drops helped some.Now, my son (6) has gotten pink eye today, as has my neighbor who was at my house last night.    I currently do not have what looks like pink eye though!    No redness, just some dryness and gritty pain at night and some discharge slightly when I sleep.I have no idea what to do now.    I have an opthomologist telling me I'm nuts, but I have people who have had contact with me having pink eye.    If I go on antibiotic drops, it will only help temporarily.Any ideas on what this could be?Thanks!!Sheri	allergy eye|infection|said|back|eyes|eye|lot|sore|pain|antibiotics|antibiotic|right

TRMT	Breast reduction. cancer patient. lumpectomy,radiation	in 2005 I had breast cancer. got a lumpectomy, lymph node surgery, and radiation on my right side.I am very large breasted. I have had increasing pain in my right shoulder, right side of my neck, and upper right side of my back. I have BCBS insurance.Do you think BCBS would allow breast reduction surgery on me to reduce my breast size to alleviate my shoulder, neck and upper back pain? A friend told me the radiation treatment probably changed the density of my breast and that it is denser and heavier and causing the pain.    I cant pay for a strictly cosmetic procedure. I have been treated for back problems by an orthopedic. I go to my oncologist every 6 months.I'm not sure what the process is to get this surgery covered under my insurance (but not as a strickly cosmetic procedure).    I live near Raleigh NC if you know of a cosmetic surgeon that could help me. thanks.	cosmetic procedure|breast reduction|lumpectomy|treatment|orthopedic|radiation|cosmetic surgeon|upper back pain|pain|right shoulder|back|shoulder|breast|node|right|increasing
FAML	10 Month old not crawling or pulling up.	"My son is almost 10 months old and was born 3 weeks early-He can sit on his own, babbles, says mama/dada, holds his own bottle, but he's not crawling or pulling up on his own yet. If I stand him up and put him next to the coffee table or bed side he can stand on his own, and even hold on with one arm. His pediatrician is concerned about his head size (we have big heads in both mine and my boyfriend's family) - they recently have performed an ultrasound and MRI on his head and both showed enlarged ventricles with excess fluid on the brain. She says sometimes this can be normal & they'll grow out of it, and other times it's called Hydrocephalus. We're going to see a Genetics Physician this week to see if we can actually pin point ""if something is wrong"" - does anyone else have similiar problems to this?

FAML	10 Year old needs constant checking	My 10 year old who has NEVER had a single issue sleeping, has developed and issue going to bed over the past 3 months.    Normally I would just tuck him in, says prayers, and move on.    The whole thing took 3 minutes.    Now he needs constant checking on - and he will go so far as force himself to stay awake so he can make sure I am checking on him.    If I don't come in, he will come and get me.    Then eventually he will insist that he cannot sleep in his room.    But, he is fine to sleep on the couch.I cannot tie to this any recent events -- school, friends, scary stuff, no family issues, etc.    It just happened like a switch - over night. One night, sleeping normal the next needed constant reassurance - to the tune of being checked on about every 10 minutes.It is frustrating and exhausting.    I need help!	reassurance|tuck|3 minutes|minutes

PREG	Is my girlfriend pregnant?	My girlfriend and I had sex on the 14th of February and again on each of the next two days. We're both 17, so having a baby isnt exactly ideal. Ever since, both of us have been absolutely terrified that she's pregnant. We used condoms every time and it was the first time either of us have had sex. Her period is irregular, usually every two or three months. Her last one was on the 6th of January, so it should have been any time between around 6th of March until April. Late, Almost 3 weeks after she's due her period, at the earliest.    Her main worry is that after I pulled out, before ejaculating, she gave me a handjob and after that I fingered her... And theres the possibility that a small amount of semen got on my fingers. She tries to reassure herself that it couldnt be possible that she's pregnant    because we used a condom and I pulled out way before ejaculating... But as the times passed and she still hasnt gotton her period, both of us are worried...    Im told that stress can delay the period, and believe me, she's been stressed. Her breasts have been sore and in the last week, she's become very snappy and moody towards everyone, says she's not in the mood for people. Could be stress from worrying she's pregnant, or could it be a sign she's pregnant or about to get her period? Im not the most knowledgable on the subject, so I could do with a little advice from someone who understands this kind of thing.Thanks.	fingers|breasts|is irregular|sore
PREG	2ndBaby, NT Testing	Hi, I read    your post under the question about amnio and cvs testing.    I kind of had the same thing happen.    After the NT test, my risk for Downs was not as great as I had expected.    I am only 20 weeks and still going back and forth about the amnio I have scheduled for this Friday. I was wondering if you could tell me what you Downs risk came back as after the NT test?    The fact that your baby was born totally healthy makes me wonder why we do these tests in the first place. I have to admit that I have been stressed since I received my ratio but decided to wait on the amnio until after my level 2 ultra sound.    Did you have a level 2 and if so, how did that come out?Any info would be great.	back

GOAL	Advice needed on a weight loss strategy	"Synopsis: I'm a vegan considering going Atkins for a short time in order to lose the last bit of very, very stubborn weight. About 50lbs of it.Confession: I've been fat all my life. Most of it I've not just been fat, but obese. in 7th grade I hit 220lbs. In high school I was at 285lbs. 5 years ago I hit 320lbs.Of course, the progression hasn't been that linear. During college I once dropped to 240, and after that spent my time bouncing between 260 and 285. After suffering through a job I didn't like, I hit 324lbs. Through work, will power, and serendipity, I've since been able to drop to 230lbs.And now I'm stuck.For the past year I've been bouncing between 226 and 240 lbs, and no matter what I do I can't seem to escape this.Currently, I'm a vegan. A low-fat vegan. No meat. No dairy (I'm lactose intolerant anyway). No eggs. And fat intake at about 12% of my total calories. Sugars come mostly from fruits. This actually helped me lose some weight at first (10 lbs total), as well as drop my blood pressure and (already low) cholesterol, but I still hit my wall. I also walk/run at least 15 miles a week, though usually I hit over 20, plus regular weight lifting. By my favorite, by far, is walking and hiking.A short while back--before I went vegan, and after gaining 20 lbs in 2 months, going from 226lbs to 246lbs--I considered medical weight loss. There I was told that I could, at most, expect to drop to 200. (My body fat percentage was about 26.6% then.) My goal was 180, but no matter: all I want is to be healthier. Besides, I already have this not-so-nifty skin hanging around which may need to be snipped.Anyway, their plan included hunger suppression medication (surprisingly, that's not a huge issue for me. I currently eat between 1800-2000 calories per day, tracked) and going on a very strict Atkins diet for a few weeks to induce ketosis. During their tests, however, they discovered I had a right bundle branch block (heart disease), so I didn't go through with it, mostly because the meds mess around with your heart. Well, turns out my RBBB is a ""normal variant"" and nothing to concern myself over. Still, this is when I decided to go vegan, which worked great until I stopped losing weight, no matter what I did. (As a side note, I used to have some chest pain when running. I was told it might be heartburn, but it went away when I went vegan)I love being a vegan. I usually feel pretty great eating like this (unless I'm eating all grains, then I just feel all heartburny). However, I need to lose weight: I'm a flat-line hypoglycemic with a very strong family history of diabetes. My biggest enemy is tummy fat. So here's my plan:Do the Atkins diet WITHOUT medical weight loss supplements (except maybe Alli) until I've lost the necessary weight (32 lbs), then switch back to vegan at that point. Yes, it does go against my ethical considerations to eat animal meat, and yes, I realize the almost absurdity of going to such extremes, but this belly fat is costing me life and putting me at risk of too many conditions, so I need to rid myself of it. In college I did Atkins successfully, dropping from almost 300 to 240. True, I did gain it all back, but unlike then, now I'm not so quick to run back to pizzas and fried chicken wings. I actually appreciate the texture and taste of a great salad.I'm wondering if I could get someone's opinion on this plan, or my situation overall. Yes, I know I've come a long way, but not nearly long enough. The last time I wasn't considered ""fat"" was when I was 4. I'm now 31. I'm tired of it.Current stats:=========Weight: 232lbsHeight: 6'1Sex: MaleBackground: HispanicFasting blood sugar: 79 (GTT showed no rise above 81, and a drop to 71 after 2 hours, before normalization)Triglycerides: 50Cholesterol: 113 total (HDL 42, LDL 65) (This was pre-vegan. Increasing anxiety for a short time was a sign that the total cholesterol was dropping, likely the LDL)Medical history:-> Right Bundle Branch Block (idiopathic)-> Gastroparesis (idiopathic, intermittent now)-> GERD (which gets worse with increasing weight)-> General Anxiety Disorder (It's gotten better)-> No gallbladder (removed in 2009)Thanks in advance."	right bundle branch block|Right Bundle Branch Block|lactose intolerant|diabetes|ketosis|obese|Still|RBBB|GERD|conditions|disease|variant|Atkins diet|overall|chest pain|heartburn|weight|hunger|tired|heartburny|heart|wings|dropping|back|order

Well...I had pus in my gum around the tooth. After deep cleanings etc that went on for 10 months, they pull it off and made me a silver one. I told them I thought it felt high in my mouth and he insisted it was the proper    height. That was yesterday. Last night I had a little throbbing pain at one point and it hurts to bite down hard or eat hard food and when I floss I feel like I am toughing a nerve. Cold doesn't seem to bother it.

Our daughter died last year and we are helping our son-in-law raise him.He is a bright child, very loving, kind hearted and still very ""innocent"" - sheltered, I guess the word is. He is on the A-B honor roll in private school.    We have no problems with his behavior at home other than he seems to ""wound up"" a lot of the time and we have to make him look directly at us sometimes to get his attention and listen to us.        He loves watching cartoons and playing games on the computer, especially the Webkinz.    There aren't many kids in our neighborhood, so he does not get much time outside playing, mostly staying inside.At school, in 1st grade, the conduct is scored as ""Green"" - good, ""Yellow"" as caution, ""Red"" as not good and ""Blue"" as the worst.    I need to explain he does not get in trouble for misconduct such as hitting,spitting, lying, etc....his problems are from talking out of turn, getting up out of his chair, demanding the teacher's attention all the time and won't be quiet - very persistent...things like that.     All last week, he was ""green"".    The teacher give them a chance to change their conduct to a better color during the day, so he ended up with ""green"".    This week though, he was yellow, BLUE, yellow, then red.    This has been up and down all year and our family is worried that his behavior will not improve. Besides losing his mom last spring, he started school a year earlier and his teacher says part of this is immaturity.     Any suggestions?

SOCL	New details emerge in hearing for Colorado theater shooting suspect	"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- So much blood the theater floor had become slippery. Bodies with horrific injuries. The eerie sound of cell phones ringing, over and over again.This is the scene Aurora police Officer Justin Grizzle said he encountered moments after entering the theater where, according to authorities, 25-year-old James Holmes killed 12 people in a July 20 shooting rampage.Grizzle testified Monday on the opening day of the preliminary hearing for Holmes, who is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons charges.The 13-year veteran wiped away tears while describing his efforts to rush badly wounded victims to the hospital in his police cruiser, including shooting victim Ashley Moser and her husband, who wanted Grizzle to turn around and head back to the theater.""He was shot in the head somewhere. He kept asking where his ... daughter was,"" Grizzle said. ""He opened the door and tried to jump out.""Grizzle said he had to drive and hold the man by his shoulder to keep him in the car.The girl the man was seeking, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, was among those killed in the shooting at a midnight showing of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" Veronica's mother, Ashley, faces a long recovery after being paralyzed in her lower half and miscarrying after the shooting.The preliminary hearing that began Monday is designed to show a judge that the state has enough evidence to proceed to trial. Prosecutors are calling scores of witnesses and outlining their evidence in the case. The hearing could go on for days.A gag order imposed by the judge in the case has limited the flow of information about the attack. However, a source said Holmes allegedly went out a rear exit door, propped it open and gathered his weapons. He then returned to the theater and tossed a canister inside before opening fire, the source said.Screaming moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, according to witnesses.It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater.While none of the four law enforcement witnesses who testified Monday offered insight into a possible motive for the shooting, some new details emerged.Police Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard said Holmes stopped the theater door from locking by using a small piece of plastic commonly used to hold tablecloths onto a picnic table. Jonsgaard also said he spotted a a shotgun and a large drum magazine that appeared to be to jammed on the floor of the theater.Holmes' attorneys are expected to argue that their client has ""diminished capacity,"" a term that, according to the Colorado Bar Association, relates to a person's ability or inability ""to make adequately considered decisions"" regarding his or her legal representation because of ""mental impairment or for some other reason.""After the hearing, Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester will determine whether there is enough evidence for Holmes to stand trial.Security was tight at the hearing. Spectators had to pass through a metal detector and then were searched again before entering the courtroom. At least nine armed officers stood guard inside, some of them scanning the audience packed with reporters and victims' family members.Holmes appeared expressionless during the hearing and did not speak. His bushy hair and long beard contrasted with the bright red hair and close-cropped looks he sported during previous appearances.During portions of the hearing, family members of victims held one another, sobbing.Earlier in Monday's hearing, police Officer Jason Oviatt -- the first officer to encounter Holmes after the rampage ended -- testified that Holmes seemed ""very, very relaxed.""Holmes, his pupils dilated, sweating and smelly, didn't struggle or even tense his muscles as he was dragged away to be searched.""He seemed very detached from it all,"" Oviatt testified, describing Holmes as unnaturally calm amid the chaos and carnage.Oviatt testified Monday that within minutes of the first calls, he responded to the theater and found Holmes standing outside in a helmet and gas mask, his hands atop a white coupe that turned out to belong to him.At first, Oviatt said, he thought Holmes was a police officer, but as he drew within 20 feet, he realized something was terribly wrong.""He was just standing there. All the other officers were running around, trying to get into the theater,"" Oviatt said.A trail of blood led from the theater. The rifle that authorities believe Holmes used in the attack lay on the ground near the building.Holmes calmly complied with all of Oviatt's orders, the officer testified.Another officer, Aaron Blue, testified later that Holmes matter-of-factly told him, without prompting, about the complex web of explosives that authorities would later find in his Aurora apartment.He told Blue that the devices ""wouldn't go off unless we set them off.""Holmes was a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, in Aurora, until he withdrew a month before being arrested outside the bullet-riddled movie theater. He had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers.His only brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police.If Holmes is ruled incompetent to stand trial, the hearing could provide the best opportunity for victims and the public to understand what happened and why.To at least one victim, it doesn't matter if Holmes stands trial.""I obviously don't want him to walk, but as long as he doesn't see the light of day again, it doesn't really much concern me beyond that,"" said Stephen Barton, who suffered wounds on his face, neck and upper torso in the shooting that night. ""To me, I see the trial as being an opportunity to learn more about what happened that night beyond just my own personal recollection.""SOURCE: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/07/justice/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html?hpt=us_c2"	pupils dilated|tense|gas|contrasted|scanning|hearing|head back|faces|torso|face|shoulder|order|arrested|said|light|packed|minutes|expressionless|beard|hands|head|hair|trial
PREG	Pregnant?	Ok so I have been having some symptoms that leading me to believe I am pregnant. I am on birth control pills but lately for some odd reason I haven't been taking them at the same time everyday (like a couple hours apart) while my period is not due for about 10 days I've been experiencing some things going on with my body.    About a month ago before my period I had light bleeding (light pinkish color) and now lately my breasts have been a little sore, I have been eating like crazy and not feeling very satisfied, I have a little cramping in my lower stomach, gas, very light lower back pains, bloating, naseua (however I get this all the time), I've been a little more tired than usual, and at night time when I lay down I keep getting the feeling like my food is coming back up my throat like acid reflux. I have taken two pregnancy tests and they both came back negative maybe I tested too early? I am really worried because I am currently unemployed because I just graduated from college with my teaching degree and can't find work, my boyfriend and I don't have a place of our own and I am still a dependent of my parents even though I am 23. Do you think it sounds like I could be pregnant? Or do you think it is related to the fact that I am stressed about getting a job next school year?Thanks for your help and advice!	birth control pills|lower back pains|symptoms|cramping|tired|sore|gas|pregnancy tests|acid reflux|light|breasts|stomach|body|throat|color|back
FAML	5 year old psycho, exhausted our options	My husband and I have four daughters together, ages 9, 7, 5, and 3.    The oldest three are his children, the youngest is mine.    We have full custody of all four children.    Our problems started when the 5 year old was 2, with small violent outbursts, hurting the cat, choking it, hurting the hamsters, and ultimately choking the toddler where I found them in her room, the youngest blue in the face.    She is a charm in public, no one believes us that we are experiencing these problems at home.    We've tried an endless number of behavior charts, positive guidance, we've been to 3 different psychologists, 5 psychiatrists, group counseling etc.    She is now five and has only shown progress in that she is getting better at manipulating, hurting, and tearing the family apart.    The 9 and 7 year old are acting out, because our attention MUST be dedicated to the 5 year old, the youngest goes to bed fearful that her sister is going to kill her. The five year old constantly tells the youngest that she is going to kill her in her sleep, pop her eyeballs out of her head, she's gone as far as telling her that I don't love her anymore, and am going to send her to a mean ladies house.    We sent her to live with his mother for about 6 months, and our family worked out peacefully, the other children began coming out of their shells, and now she is back, and we are stuck in a hard place.    We don't know what options we have here.	group counseling|eyeballs|shells|head|choking|charm|face|back

I have even gotten to the point where I knew that if I spanked him I didn't think I would stop.    I haven't done that.    I would never hurt my baby, but it worries me that I get that angry.    Also my son did not start sleeping through the night until he was 1.    He was doing good but now all of the sudden he wakes up every night and has one of his fits.

DISE	Hormones!!	Question for anyone who can help!!    I had switched my birth control pills due to never wanting to have sex and because I always felt grouchy.    I started new pills which gave me a yeast infection and made me feel very emotional at times.    Do a week and a half before finishing the pack I stopped them.    Right after stopping them I got a wheezing in my lungs.    I let it go for about 2 weeks before I went to the doc thinking it was just bronchitis.    The doc thought it was asthma and gave me stuff for it.    That night I had a racing heart that would not stop even hours after the albuterol should have wore off (120-160 beats a minute).    That next morning I went to the ER and they did blood work and it came back that my TSH was .22 and said I had hyperthyroid and gave me beta blockers for my heart.    I went to my regular doc and they had me do more test Free T3 and Free T4 which came back normal.    I have never had problems with asthma before in my life but have had issues with my heart racing.    I go see and endocrinologist the end of July.    Just wondering if anyone else thinks this is just a hormone clash that I got myself into!?!?	birth control pills|racing|yeast infection|hyperthyroid|bronchitis|asthma|said|lungs|heart|back

PREG	my daughet has a yeast infection under her arms	My one month old has a yeast infection on both armpits. When I seen this rash on her arms it was so bad so very red with white puss, so when I took her to the doctor they said its normal because babies have creases and when there is most there it can resolve in a rash. so they gave me a cream, which is working very well. I never knew there was such a thing like that. Other wise she is doing awesome. She smiles all day, even when I just look at her, her face lights up.

FAML	9 yr old angry and disrespectful 24/7	"I am a 28 yr old mother of 3. Ages 9,6 and 5. Their father and I have been together for 10 years. Honestly we fought for the 1st 8 years, but we are working on our issues. My son, who is 9 is always angry, frustrated, disrespectful, always antaganizing and picking on his younger brother and sister, causing constant fights. It's almost like he has middle child syndrom(syndrome). It's so hard because my middle child, Alyssa is always behaving and doing what she is told. She is never mouthy or disrespectful, and if she does get in trouble, all you do is have to give her a look, that you are dissapointed, and she is upset and behaves for the rest of the day. I ask her to do something, like clean her room, or pick up her things, or just get ready for school, and she just does it, no questions asked, and of course, we say thank you, you did a good job. I know my boys get very Jealous, and I really think this is what most of it is about. Jealousy... and his father and I fighting in front of him in his earlier years. We do encourage him and try to make him not so angry, but asking him to do one simple task is like asking him to drink a bottle of hot sauce. There has to be somthing I can do. I try taking things away, putting him in time out, and on accasion spanking him. NOTHING is working. He rolls his eyes, mutters nasty things about us under his breath, such as, we are the worst parents and we ruin everything. On the contrary, when we buy him something, go somewhere fun, or go out to eat, his whole attitude changes, to    really just kissing our but. But as soon as we say no to something, it starts all over. He has a kind heart and is very loving at times. He thinks we think he is stupid, I really do not know why, we never say or do things to make him feel that way. He clenches his fists in anger, bangs his head against the wall, says he wishes he would die, and he wants to run away. I know he is frustrated, so I and his father have had many ""heart to hearts"" with him, to find out what the inner issue may be,and it goes really well... but minutes later, it's like we never even talked, like it just went in one ear and out the other. I'm sure your advise is that he may need counceling, which I am considering and currently looking into. But in the mean time, as a parent WHAT CAN I DO?? I am at a lost and almost sometimes, and harsh as it may sound, I feel like I don't like him.. I love him, care about him, you know, I am his mother, I want what's best, but he is just so mean , mad and disrespectfull. PLEASE HELP THIS FAMILY. What can I do to make him not so mad. To make him happy, so he takes our praises to heart and feels good about himself.???"	heart|eyes|head|ear|CAN|hearts|Alyssa|syndrom(syndrome|minutes

DISE	How do you know if you are on too many pills?	I have been really sick lately. Then last night I thought what if it is all the different pills I take. I can't go to my PCP she is too busy. I get 10 minutes tops. I can't go to my Neurologist he is too busy and some of the medications are not for MS. I may talk to a doctor friend who is a pharmacologist. His specialty is drug interactions.I take medicines for asthma, hypothyroid, allergies, migraine, muscle spasms, neurological pain, stomach, and gynecological.I get more and more symptoms and get prescribed more medications. Now I am wondering if the medications or interactions are causing many of my symptoms. I would like to back off some of the drugs one by one but even that is complicated. I used to be good at not going on medication. Now it seems I have been lulled into taking a medication for everything.I did not know you have to back off Baclofen slowly. It can cause all kinds of problems if you go off to quickly.I feel kinda of embarrased to even bring it up to my doctors. Heck they hand you a script and do not even go over how far to spread all the medications out in a day. I have like a bunch of pills that just say twice a day which would be fine except you have so many. It can't be good for your liver to just take handfuls of pills at one time.I was so sick late last night I wanted to go to the ER, but what could they really do? I am dropping weight and there is no medical explanation. I really think I have reached my max of medications. I have so many drug sheets from the pharmacy I just have gotten overwhelmed them. Then I have sample and over the counter drugs and the inserts with writing so small I can no longer read it. None of them go over the interactions of every drug I am on. Not to mention multiple drug interactions with each other causing a problem with a third drug.Alex	neurological pain|symptoms|spasms|weight|hypothyroid|asthma|PCP|stomach|liver|hand|dropping|back|sample|minutes

SOCL	Under healthcare reforms some preventative care will be free	"Wednesday, Jul 14, 2010 15:35 ETUnder healthcare reforms some preventative care will be freeCovered services include cancer screenings, immunizations and healthy weight counseling for kidsBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Associated Press*From counseling for kids who struggle with their weight, to cancer screenings for their parents, preventive health care will soon be available at no out-of-pocket cost under consumer rules the Obama administration unveiled Wednesday.That means no copays, deductibles or coinsurance for people whose health insurance plans are covered by the new requirements.The Obama administration estimates that 41 million Americans will benefit initially, with the number projected to rise to 88 million by 2013. Many large company plans, which usually offer solid preventive benefits, will be exempt from the requirements for the time being.Better preventive coverage is one of the goals of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law, part of a shift to try to catch problems early, before high cholesterol can lead to heart disease.""Services like these will go a long way in preventing chronic illnesses that consume over 75 percent of the health care spending in this country,"" said first lady Michelle Obama, announcing the new benefits at a Washington hospital.Better preventive care may be an investment, but it still carries an upfront cost. Premiums will go up by 1.5 percent on average, as spending for the services is spread broadly across an entire pool of insured people.For individuals who are diligent about their checkups, that can mean considerable out-of-pocket savings. For example, a 58-year-old woman at risk of heart disease could save at least $300 out of her own budget on recommended tests, ranging from diabetes and cholesterol screening, to a mammogram and a flu shot.Research has shown that people tend to skip recommended preventive care if cost is an issue, and even a modest copayment can make a difference. Cost-free prevention was one idea that received widespread support during the contentious health care debate last year in Congress.The prevention requirements take effect for health plans renewing on or after Sept. 23, which means most beneficiaries will see them starting Jan. 1. Coincidentally, that's also when Medicare recipients get access to most preventive services at no out-of-pocket cost -- another change under the health care law.Under the requirements announced Wednesday, health insurance plans have to cover four sets of preventive services at no additional charge to their members.These include:-- Screenings strongly recommended with a grade of ""A"" or ""B"" by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent advisory panel. Among them are breast and colon cancer tests, screening of pregnant women for vitamin deficiencies, tests for diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, as well as counseling to help smokers quit.-- Routine vaccines from childhood immunizations to tetanus boosters for adults.-- Well-baby visits to a pediatrician, vision and hearing tests for kids, and counseling to help youngsters maintain a healthy weight. These and other services are recommended under guidelines developed by the government and the American Academy of Pediatrics.-- Women's health screenings, also to include test called for under guidelines that are still in development and not expected to be be announced until Aug., 2011.Large employer plans will not be affected by the new requirements if they are ""grandfathered"" under the health overhaul law. Lawmakers created that exception so Obama could deliver on his promise that the law would not force wholesale changes in existing insurance plans. However, as employers make changes to their plans, many stand to lose the exemption, meaning they would eventually have to comply."	vitamin deficiencies|chronic illnesses|diabetes|said|flu|disease|cancer screenings|health screenings|Screenings|screening|hearing|administration|counseling|prevention|boosters|immunizations|weight|catch|breast|heart

PREG	BD Frequency - Found this interesting	Intercourse FrequencyThere has been some speculation that couples who are trying to conceive should reduce the frequency of sexual intercourse during the fertile window to increase sperm supply. This is not true for most couples. While couples with known male factor issues should consult their doctor for the best intercourse strategy, couples with normal fertility and no known sperm issues should not reduce the frequency of intercourse in the fertile window. Your probability of conception is increased when you have intercourse multiple times in your fertile window. While it is true that sperm concentrations decrease slightly with increasing intercourse frequency, frequent intercourse is still more likely to result in conception than infrequent intercourse for couples with no male factor fertility issues. Each additional act of intercourse within your fertile window increases your probability of conception for that cycle.	act|increasing

His head is still big--and a little long    but looks like it fits him-and big heads run on my side of the family. I still don't fit into normal size hats. He has seen his regular pediatrican for the last 10 months and he has never mentioned anything concerning his head. He was just there 6 weeks ago to get his ears checked and the Dr looked over his head and forehead and all over and said nothing--except he is healthy and actually developing ahead ( has six teeth-trying to walk etc) - We took thim to the office on an emergency since he hit his tooth    and it was bleeding a lot and saw another doctor there who has not seen him since he was 3 months old. She said he is fine developmentally and his brain is fine--but she was worried about his forehead beign to big and not wanting it to grow out more towards the front and wants us to see a Neurosurgen next week. She said she was only thining in terms of cosmetically? Our regular Doctor is gone til Tuesaday.    I am so worried. Our Dr has never mentioned anything. She said his soft spots are still there but small. I feel a    a little ridge but isn't that normal now for that sagittal area?

And nowadays. my OCD and insomnia are quite inter-related each others.Everytime, I am going to bed, I has some thoughts my hand is so dry and have to use some gels to make it wet. Or I need to check the door lock although I know that is already locked. So if I start doing that, my body becomes fresh and I cannot sleep. If I don't do at all, my mind keep reminding me that I must do it and I cannot sleep as well. sometimes, very wired tiredness is inside me and I was sweating under Aircon.last year, I went to psychiatrist and he prescribed me Zosert 25 mg for 6 months and Alprozolam for sometimes incase necessary. OCD was improved and I can sleep for several months.1) Anyone can share you experiences / your advises as well ?2) I read some articles that Zosert can affect your sperm quantity. Since me and my wife are trying to have a baby.

DISE	The visit with the Yale MS specialist	"I saw the MS specialist today. Let's say that at the start, I was highly impressed. I was there for around an hour and a half!!There were three people in the room with me and my husband (specialist later). The PA took my info and told me to tell her everything, no matter how insignificant it seemed to me. Wow. Meanwhile, the medical student was glancing over my records. I did mention how the prior neuro had misleading info in his report. The other med student took my MRI CD to the specialist for her to look at alone (she never discussed it with me though.)The first med student did a thorough neuro exam. With socks off too, lol. Althoughhhh, she almost forgot to do the Babinski, was reminded by the other PA. I was having left leg twitches, and seemed skittish. I told her she was going too fast, I couldn't process some of her directions. She had me say the alphabet backwards, which I felt stupid on, but I did it. Dh laughed when I got all discombobulated with the finger-nose-finger fast-as-you-can stuff, my left finger was missing things. All of the above took about 1/2 hour.Anyway, the neuro came and she was not as personable as her staff. But, she did do a neuro exam all over again. Both of them had asked me if I watched the news. No. Sheesh, why? (I call it the Evening Crime Report.) I didn't mention that I READ the news online. I don't live in a bubble! I had to spell the word ""world"", forward and backwards though.Bottom line: I do NOT HAVE MS. She wonders how my thyroid is. FINE. I had a complete CBC and other levels checked in December. She thinks it's something metabolic..........?? Please explain that to me, I don't get it.She believes I would benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, 10-15 sessions, to help me learn to live in my body. To help me adapt to this pain I am suffering, since I am rather anxious. What?!**I don't even TAKE A SINGLE MED for pain!!!** I have burning and twitching and banding, not exactly pain.Excuse me. My eyes were shut. She was poking me, I jumped. :-/ She used the reflex hammer, I reacted. If someone starts to poke you, naturally wouldn't you cringe? But my EYES WERE SHUT. I didn't specifically cringe because I knew anything was coming. Trust me, I was trying to make everything as casual and relaxed, so they could do what they needed to do, without me tipping the odds. Several folks yesterday mentioned here that I get a diagnosis, not try for an MS diagnosis. Excellent point! And I did my best.Once she seemed to be done, my dh and I started in with our questions. I'm not sure, but I think she was implying that I am not comfortable in my self, that I overreact to stimuli. I blush easily, and I could feel my face turning red. With 5 people (including dh) looking at me. Joy.She thinks I have Restless Legs Syndrome as well.And here is where I made a bold stupid mistake. I told her that it had been suggested that I have RLS, and I looked it up online and no,I don't have that.Dr. got her back up and told me that SHE is the DOCTOR, you can't do a checklist online and diagnose yourself. She all but gritted her teeth. I did demure to that, but then again, what if I read a checklist of symptoms on a piece of paper in her waiting room, vs. looking up the wemove.org website online, what is the difference?!?! I am still of the idea that she didn't need to get her knickers in a knot! She did go get a sample of Requip for me but more on that later.With more discussion, she seemed to back off a bit and decided to include a thoracic MRI to complete my file.AND really responded to the idea that my ferritin level was low. She had not looked at my labs, and there was a lightbulb over her head and AHA! appeared in her eyes when that came up. (my ferritin is a 5 on a level of 11-307....what kind of a range is that?!) But my iron is fine. I am confused.Soooo....I am to take iron pills twice a day for 3 weeks (and MiraLax to help with iron-related constipation), have the T-spine locally, then see her in 3 weeks for the final let-go. Depending on the bloodwork to check the ferritin, she might give me the Requip sample at the next visit. She gave me the name of a local neuro for finding out what it is, if not MS.I heard her tell one med student that with the upper AND lower hyperreflexia that I exhibited today, she doesn't know what it is, but she is SURE the t-spine will show it is not MS.I looked it up and found this page on the Google search (upper and lower hyperreflexia). It was enough to make me tear up. The actual link is a bazillion characters long, so I can't really attempt to post it, but the info was eye-opening. It mentions lesions of the brain or brainstem.Enough for now.Thank you to all of you who have held me up and prayed for me. I keep telling God I will do His will, maybe the Journey is ALSO part of that process huh?Suzanne"	Restless Legs Syndrome|behavioral therapy|discussion|reminded|banding|neuro exam|diagnose|sample|brainstem|left leg|finger|spine|brain|nose|body|eyes|EYES|head|eye|symptoms|burning|finding|spell|blush|pain|face|back|thoracic

FAML	NEED HELP FOR 4 YR OLD!!	"My 4 yr old(5 in Jan.) is very emotional. He has been desribed at school as having very emotional weeks. He gets upset very easily and tears come. They do go away very quickly though. His teacher says he gets upset when it is time to go and do the daily activities. He would rather still play. They say this is ""normal"" and will grow out of it. I am at my wits end. His teacher told me that in the 10 years of teaching, she has never seen a kid this emotional and sensitive. I have been the our doctor three times about this and he was evaluated by the school with multiple therapists. I was told it was a maturity thing and he will grow out of it. He is academically where he should be and has no problems there. He does seem very immature in comparison to the other kids. They seem more mature then him in many ways. He is a very loving boy who you can take anywhere. He is realle behaved at home and he is so easy going. AT school it is very different. Please help me, I feel there is something wrong. Am I just a paranoid motther, After all he is my baby!! Also, he has very ""weird"" tendencies like if he falls sometimes he doesnt want you near him and other times he wants you to kiss his boo boo.

SOCL	Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia	have a 6ft, 240 lb 15yr old with severe leg pain and weakness. We began seeing a Orthopedist when he was 3 for toe walking and inversion of the feet. Diagnosis.....tibial torsions. Into physical therapy we went with shoe inserts. As he grew he required more and more physical therapy. And is now on his 4 set of inserts. At 12 he began having horrible leg pain. He often was unable to participate in activities and we had to change plans as a result. At this time the x-rays showed flat feet and hammer toes. Leg pain was to the point of barely walking sometimes. All through this the therapist was documenting tight tendons. As a result he had bilateral heel lengthenings in 2007. He did well and was able to perform in the school musical as the lead and grew 6 inches. Then the back spasms started and the unretractable leg pain. It was so bad one day the school wanted to call an ambulance to get him. He has been on many different pain medications. And back to physical therapy again. After the 3rd appointment the therapist refused to treat him saying he needed a hamstring lengthening. Prior to this he had seen 2 different neurologist. The first saying he needed pyschological help since his EMG was normal. The other changed his medicine and again sent him to physical therapy. He usually can't make it all week at school although he walks with a cane. Stairs are impossible and forget getting on the floor. Prior to all this he was active and very helpful. He is becoming depressed because he can't even do simple things. A trip to an amusement park left him crying in pain for 2 days not to mention extremely humiliated. His twin brother is becoming frustrated because he needs to help more around the house. I might add that He had 2 MRI's a lumbar and a thoracic. I am so frustrated and my son is devastated. The doctor told him today surgery of his legs would not help him. We just returned from a 3 day stay at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY, 2 hours from our home. They have given him a tentative diagnosis of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. Genetic testing is scheduled. Is there anything we can do to help him?	hamstring lengthening|lengthenings|severe|physical therapy.

TRMT	Protein Supplements	"I have a question whether I should or not supplement my diet with protein shake.    I have read good and bad things about whey protein.    Some studies indicate it is good and some say its unhealthy.    Unhealthy protein supplements especially whey is from cow's given growth hormones, steroids, antibiotics and etc.    The healthy one is organic and cold processed and that is promoted as best. Some studies say whey protein contains blood antigens and can induce some reactions in individuals that consume it.    I don't know how true is this.I would like to supplement but which one should I take.    I am tired next day after exercise and sports and it takes long time to be okay.    Plus I am out of shape and that is also the reason.    How is vegan protein supplements.I have also lost weight mostly muscle and bone, and that is most likely because of inactivity.    So any advice on what protein supplements are safe and easy digested and assimilated by our body.This is article-For problems with non-organic whey protein see ""Say No Way!

DEMO	Baby with very large head and slight milestone delays	My grandson's head is very very large - his fontanelle has not closed - he is 9 months and because of his head size, my daughter is under scrutiny as a social worker is saying my grandson has FAS which is impossible as she didn't and doesn't drink or take drugs. He was seen and tested by a specialist at 7m 23days - the test results indicated his large motor skills were at 7 months, his cognition was 6 months but his fine motor skills were at 4 months. So, he is considered developmentally delayed. They are going to be putting him under anesthesia to do an MRI and he will also have EEG.

DEMO	Abortion- After first period, ovaries pain  and backache	Hi , I'm not sure if this is the right site to post this , but thought i'd give it a try.On November 24th I had a surgical abortion - the vacum aspiration, that i deeply, deeply regret. But , it would have been impossible to raise a child now, as i'am in my 2nd year in university, have one day job a week, and my fiance although works full time, would have struggled to support us both . Anyway, feeling depressed from that at the moment , as I did not want an abortion but I knew deep down it was for the best .5 weeks and 6 days after the procedure, my period arrived. A few days before the normal cramps i suffer from, and it seemed like a normal period, although did pass    a clot about 1cm (sorry tmi), and period finished 4 days later.However, on the 6th day after period i have been having pain in my ovaries both of them and dull back ache. A first, I thought it could be ovulation pain, as I read it gets more intense after termination. But , that would'nt explain the pain in both sides, although its majority to my left side.Hope somebody can help.P.s I did have the check up done 2 weeks later, and they said no tissue had been retained, and did finish the course of antibiotics , and have no symptoms of fever or anything.Thanks in advance for any advice :-)	feeling depressed|back ache|symptoms|cramps|pain|procedure|abortion|ovaries|said|ovulation|antibiotics|right

TRMT	How high is too high when it comes to B6 blood levels?	"Hi Guys,I'm a 29 year-old female whose exercises regularly, eats well and doesn't drink or smoke and have been lucky to have had great health for most of my life.    Over the last year and a half, though, I've suddenly developed symptoms including neuropathy, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, frequent headaches, insomnia and dizzy spells.I have been tested for MS, Lyme Disease, Diabetes and a variety of autoimmune diseases, but, luckily that testing all came back negative.    My blood levels were tested for several vitamins and the only thing that came back as being out of normal ranges was my B6 level. I was told it was 41.7 ng/mL, with the normal range being 2-22 ng/mL.    (The 41.7 nanograms/mL equals 168.71 nanomoles/L, if you are more familiar with that unit of measurement).The nurse who called me about the test results told me that I should stop taking supplements containing B6 (I'd been taking both a B Complex and a Multi-Vitamin containing B6 for several years, which was giving me about 450% of the RDA each day) and come back in two months to have my levels re-tested.    When I asked her if the doctor (a neurologist) thought my symptoms could be attributed to the high B6 levels, she said ""yes.""However, I had a follow-up visit with the neurologist today, several weeks after my phone conversation with the nurse, and he said he didn't think my levels were high enough to be causing my symptoms.    When I asked what he thought could be causing them, he couldn't give me an answer, since all of my blood work and testing on my spinal fluid from a lumbar puncture had come back normal.I'm upset and confused, since after my conversation with the nurse had led me to believe I'd finally found the cause of my health problems.    I'm interested in hearing if anyone else has had experience with developing symptoms of B6 toxicity with blood levels similar to mine.    I'm just wondering if I should trust what this doctor is telling me or if I should seek a second opinion on this.Thanks for your input!"	autoimmune diseases|Lyme Disease|neuropathy|Multi|said|Diabetes|frequent headaches|symptoms|pain|hearing|back|B6 level

FAML	Fear or anxiety?	We have a 9 year old son (only child) who has always had fear of the dark. He from very young will not go into Halloween stores because of the scary items. He will not watch Harry Potter or do any type of 3-D movie because of his fear. While at his cousins' visiting he watched a scary movie and    is now terrified to go anywhere in the house alone. It used to be just when it was dark but now it is an issue that has disrupted everything. I am starting to think it is so much more and I do not know how to help him. Any suggestions?	
SOCL	To break up, or to try harder?	"This has been eating at me for a while.. Just a little advice may help. I am 22 years old.History is this --Best friend, met at age 13. Boyfriends in between, but he yearned for me always.Age 16, I give in, me and best friend become a couple. Very much in love, a spiritual connection like none other.Age 17, I move and long distance is hard.    Bad break up.Age 17-21 Stuggle with my lost love, we become best friends again, but I always harbor these feelings. I did everything in my power to get over it.    Sometimes I thought I did, but I only lied to myself.    We visit once a year. He becomes very good at hiding his feelings. To this day, unsure how he feels. He still talks to me about everything, every girl he's with seems to never be up to standard, but any hint of feelings for me come out as ""You're in your ""own special catagory""    not friend not lover, my guiding light.""Age 21- A visit from him turns out bad. He leaves on bad terms due to mind games on both of our parts. In fact, he stole off during the night leaving a note that said I was ""exiled"" and he'd never speak to me again. 2 weeks later, I'm still numb from our fight, and actually feel refreshed that I feel for him like that no longer, but he contacts me telling me he loved me, I was his best friend and he could never stop talking to me. Things warmed up a little. But I find a new boyfriend.    It's a little rash, but he seemed enanmored with me at first glance.21-22 (current!) - This is where it gets tricky. My new lover and me start out great. He starts to get a little serious too fast (as I'm still healing from ""best friend"") but we work it out. I begin to love this new person, we get along great, have all kinds of interests, and he is completely in love with everything about me. I waver back and forth because he's not as intelligent or quick witted as I'm used to, not as thoughtful (he cares, he's just a little niave when it comes to romance due to a bad childhood), and he is a little un reliable and has a hard time getting used to adult life.    But I decided to keep trying. He has improved a lot since we met, but still not up to par. I got a job offer, and I had a 2 week notice to move 3500 miles away. Coincidentally... 3500 closer to ""best friend"". New lover would not accept me going alone. So he left his family, his friends, everything, and left with me. I've been here 3 months. I'm continually frustrated with him due to lies (small ones, the ones you make because you don't want to look stupid because he HATES looking stupid around me), his lack of ambition or goals in life. He TRIES which is why I stay with him. He is extremely devoted, loyal, gentle and I can almost feel the terror in his heart when he thinks I'm ready to give up. We keep a couples journal and he writes endlessly about how things will change, how he plans for this, and he'll show me this and that, and how he will do anything to keep me forever. I love him dearly, but I don't feel like I'm IN LOVE with him anymore. Worst even, talking to ""best friend"" now that I'm only a bit of a drive away.. I wonder if we are destined as I used to think.. the spiritual connection we had (even apart, he'd know if something was wrong without me contacting him) .. I just don't know.    I am a very empathetic person, and now that it's been over a year with new lover.. I can't bear to break his heart and do what?    Send him back home?    What if I make a mistake?    If I was to break up with him.. how the hell would I do this? It's scary to think about... but if it's not going to work in the long run, isn't waiting going to make it even worse for him? Sometimes I just want freedom to explore any other options, like meeting someone in my area who has all the qualities I want in someone.But then I think about how loved I am.. not all people are as lucky to have someone so devoted, who would walk 8 hours across town to see you for 30 minutes (yes he did this..) who states at you in adoration even being a semi-attractive overweight woman.    I don't know if I'm being picky... if I'm just not ready to settle... if I secretly still long for best friend.. or if I'm being ridiculous and need to work on this as hard as I can.Sorry it was so long, but I don't talk to anyone about this so it kinda all came flooding out.Any response would be appreciated."	flooding|heart|lot|said|semi|light|rash|back

DISE	Swelling to top of right foot... Please help :(	HelloLast friday i woke up and my right foot was very achy and sore when pressure was placed on top of foot by way of socks, shoes, and even the air touching it or me rubbing it on the bed or chair made it hurt. It swelled up quite a bit compared to the left foot.The area is below the ankle but round toward top of foot and on the side.There is no pain under the foot, or on the ankle or on any other part of the foot.I had not hurt the foot prior to this, no bang, knock, or no sudden movement to cause a muscle issue.At night it goes down, but the next day it begins to swell again, it troubles me through the night if it rubs on the bedsheets etc.My GP said its unusal in this area of the foot and theres no idication of bone trouble as other areas would hurt on examination. Ive been on anti-inflamatorys plus ibruefin and it still aches :(Its like a dull ache all the time :(Does anyone have any advice, ive never had foot issues and ive not recently started wearing new shoes either.Thanks in advance.(ive added a pic in the hope someone can help thanks.)	aches|sore|pain|ache|foot|bone|pic|said|right|touching

GOAL	Does pain after crown prep mean root canal?	I had crowns prepped on lower left side, 2 molars, 2 weeks ago.    2 days after they were prepped, I started having pain and could not bite on that side.    The pain is a dull throbbing pain that goes away completely with just 1 tylenol or 1 motrin (200 mg).    But eventually after 8 to 10 hours it comes back.I went to have the bite adjusted on the temps b/c I thought they were high.    Now they are completely low b/c my other teeth feel like they are hitting harder now and starting to bother me on the upper now too.Do you think I should go to endodontist at this point for root canals or wait for permanent crowns and see if it gets better.Does it ever talk over 2 weeks for a tooth to settle down after prepping?	throbbing pain|pain|molars|canals|tooth|root|back|endodontist

I had an ultrasound today and the doctor and the technician were able to see a heart flicker of 113, a fetal pole and an amniotic sac, however, he was very concerned about the size and scheduled another ultrasound in 2 weeks. They said the machine showed that i'm 5 weeks and 6 days pregnant, whereas according to them I should be 6 weeks and 1 day. I'm very concerned. On my way out the nurse told me that it could be chromosomal and that I could miscarry. Have any of you experienced this and had normal babies? Can this be due to late implantation and still have a normal baby? Please, help.	implantation|ultrasound|flicker|said|heart|pole

GOAL	Anti-VEGF drugs and macular conditions	Can you tell me what is going on to expand the indications and approval of the anti-VEGF drugs so that there is full Medicare and insurance coverage. Lucentis and Macugen are only FDA-approved for wet AMD, yet these drugs are useful in many other retinal inflammatory conditions, often the only treatment available for these problems, yet insurance won't pay. Of course, they won't pay for Avastin at all and I understand the reason for that, since it would only hurt the profitability of Lucentis. What can possibly be the justification by the insurance companies to leave patients without coverage for Lucentis or Macugen, the only things that might help a variety of sight-threatening conditions?	treatment|retinal|conditions
SOCL	Concentration difficulties	For as long as I remember I have had difficulty concentrating. Throughout high school I barely did any of the assigned readings and just winged it at homework assignments. The problem that I have is that I am now about to enter grad school and I'm worried that my coping strategy won't work anymore. As an illustration, this past semester I took a course on reading French, but even having finished that course I can't say that I am able to read texts at the level being taught. I used coping mechanisms that allowed me to pass the course without really learning the material.It's not a matter of interest, I just can't concentrate most of the time even if I find the material really interesting. When reading, I even have difficulty focussing or words or sentences long enough to understand the text. I feel like there is a cloud of static activity that my mind cannot penetrate. I usually have an easier time with spoken word, but even then I have difficulties at times.It's not only with academic pursuits either, when I can't concentrate I find it difficult to do anything. I can't focus enough to watch tv, do chores, cook, et cetera.I also find that when I speak, I am constantly going back and revising what I have just said to the point that my speech is extremely difficult to follow. It feels like my mind keeps jumping around to different topics so that it makes it difficult to express a comprehensible thought. This is also present in my written work.When I have an episode where I can't concentrate, I find that I become anxious/angry at my inability to think which seems to make matters worse. However, I don't think that this is caused by anxiety itself as it can also be present without anxiety.What could be causing this?	winged|coping|speech|back|said

DISE	I need advice ASAP!	hi. i am worried that what i thought was razor burn could be something much worse, possibly herpes. before i ever even became sexually active, i've had sensitive skin near my genitals. i shave regularily and am familiar with razor burn as i get it quite a lot. my first partner (whom i am still with) has only ever had sex with me, and when we first had sex he was my frist as well. we had been dating for several years when we broke up and i randomly slept with a friend of a friend. he said he was clean, but you can never be quite sure so now i am constantly freaking out. before this random one-night stand, i would sometimes get these bumps on the left hand side of my labia near my leg (so on the outside) after i would shave, especially if i wore tight clothing after i shaved. Shortly after this one night stand me and my boyfriend got back together and I was worried I had sometime as I didn't want him to get it, so i went and got a general exam from my nurse practitioner. She said she would call if anything came back that was worrysome, and she nver called...but I didn't get a blood test so I'm worried that some things haven't been tested.I had sex with the friend of a friend near the end of April, and the first sign of a sore happened near the beginning of July. I had razor burn and was wearing tight jeans for a while and developed a boil-like sore underneath my labia. it hurt alot and seemed like it could be popped, but i left it alone and it went away, without scabbing or anything. shortly after i got a single sore on the inside of my labia that pussed when i popped it, then scabbed over and went away.A few weeks ago (probably 2) me and my boyfriend went camping and i shaved (upwards) with a dull 5 blade razor that gave me HORRIBLE razor burn. i wore little shorts which only made it worse and it was rough camping so i couldn't shower for a few days after, although i did swim in the lake. The razor burn went away on the upper part of pubic area, but little bumps stayed on the lower. they hurt and were insanely itchy, which i itched. they started going away but when i shaved again they came back and seemed worse. there is a cluster of small red bumps that after a few days developed white-ish heads. when i picked them off it basically took the whole sore off and caused it to bleed. they all roughed over and some are little scabs and others just look like skin where a scab has just fallen off from. the area is rough but i keep itching it so i feel i may be preventing it from healing. About a week ago i put some zinc-oxide creme on the area to reduce the razor burn but it didn't do anything (i then realized the cream has been expired for a few years, oops!). I am so worried abuot this, it is constantly on my mind. oh and i also get urinary tract infections frequently, or sometimes jsut the feeling of one when i become dehydrated or when i forget to pee right after sex. i would go to my doctors but it is really hard to get appointments there and i just need peace of mind!..or the cold hard truth. thank you.	urinary tract infections|herpes|said|boil|genitals|labia|hand|lot|leg|near end|heads|back|sore|right

TRMT	Pelvic Organ Prolapse, cystocele, urethrocele, and rectocele	I was diagnosed by the Urologist I see with, pelvic organ prolapse; bladder prolapse (cystocele) and urethral prolapse (urethrocele) and rectal prolapse (rectocele). He stated that surgery would be the only option to corrent these problems. He suggested a plastic ring thing but this does not interest me at all. He said my bladder was extending past pelvic bone during stress situations (coughing, sneezing). I am scheduled to see my GYN in a week and a half and the Urologist said she will make the surgery decisions with me. He said if she calls him in for the bladder part of the surgery then he will assist. I will have a    hysterectomy also.Has anyone else been through this type of surgery? Any pointers? I have talked with my sister and friends that have been through similar surgery and they gave me a range of 1 week to 2 months of recovery time. None of them had as many things go wrong, prolapse, so they said they did not know much else except their experience. Makes sense.This is why I would really appreciate any information any one out there has regarding the three prolases I have had happen and any pointers they can give regarding the surgery.	urethral prolapse|bladder prolapse|urethrocele|prolapse|said|cystocele|sense|pelvic organ|bladder|pelvic|bone|diagnosed|coughing|corrent problems
FAML	8 year old wont go to sleep by herself	My daughter is 8 1/2 and will not go to sleep by herself. I have to sit on her bed and read book after book until she is asleep and and if she hears me leave the room she starts to cry. I dont know how to break this and it makes matters worse due to the fact she still sleeps with her dad every other weekend. Any suggestions? Also when I try to leave the room when she is awake and I have read a book she complains of stomach pains. Its driving me crazy!	stomach|pains
FAML	What are we doing wrong?	Our daughter who will be 3 this July listens to me, her dad just fine.    When I tell her to do things, she listens most of the time, and she doesn't argue with me or fight with me about most of the things that go on with her on a day to day basis.    But when it comes to my wife, she won't listen to her, and defies her most of the time and fights with her and then hits my wife.    If my wife tries to put her down for a nap or to bed at night, which both of us usually lay with her and get her to fall asleep and then leave her to sleep on her own.    When I put her down, she goes down usually within a half an hour or less, but with my wife she fights with her and doesn't go down for much longer, if at all and many times, I have to go upstairs and either tell her to listen to her mom or I end up taking over and putting her to bed.    It's not like my wife is doing alot of things different than me, but she just won't listen to her or respect her.    This has been going on for close to 6 months when she was an only child, but now we have a 1 month old as well, and it seems to be the same or worse and is wearing on the both of us.    What are we doing wrong, and how can we fix this before it gets worse.

GOAL	How to Stretch the Food Budget	"With so much unemployment/low wages these days, it seems that more and more people are having to find extraordinary ways to stretch their food dollars.    I know that everyone tries different things, so I'm putting this post out there to see how many ideas we can come up with to help stretch those dollars the most and still get the healthy food we need to help achieve/maintain our goals for weight loss.1)    Clip coupons, but make sure you only use the ones for things that you really need; and make sure you compare the price of the item for which you have a coupon, with the store version of the same item -- even with a coupon, the store version may be cheaper.2)    Try using fat free milk powder in some recipes in place of ""real"" milk.    Powdered milk can even be reconstituted and mixed with real milk in order to make that gallon of milk go further.3)    Buy cheaper cuts of meat and roast or stew them or add marinades to make them more tender.    If you have a crock pot, this is a great way to have dinner ready when you get home from work.    Also buy in bulk as much as you can, split the packages and freeze extras.    Make sure you have good containers to use for freezing because you won't save any $ if you have to throw away food because it freezer burned.4)    Make soups or stews in larger quantities and freeze some for later.5)    Don't spend precious grocery $ on snack items.    If you feel that you need snacks, try finding a good recipe for a ""party mix"" using various kinds of cereal, then buy the store brands of cereal and make your own snacks.    This is more healthy than chips or candy and most kids will even enjoy it.    You can try putting different spices on it to change the flavors.6)    I've noticed that Dollar Stores are beginning to carry more grocery items, such as canned goods, fresh bread, etc -- make sure you check them out to see what's available.    I notice that the Dollar Store on the corner by my house is less expensive on a lot of items than my grocery store.7)    Make your soups go further and more filling by adding pearled barley or brown rice to the pot.    Just don't overcook the rice or it will get mushy.Okay -- that's some of my ideas -- let's see how creative we can get............"	stretch|finding|weight|lot|canned|order

I live in Virginia and I can't find anything on the HCG shots here. What kind of clinic are you going to that gives you this shot/program. I dont know where to begin searching for one. Did you look online, in the telephone books, etc? I just search for weight loss clinics and nothing really comes up. If you could let me know how you found a clinic in your area and what they are listed under (bariatric, weight loss, etc) it would be so helpful. Also if you live in Virginia, recommend a place to go to.	weight

DISE	a more descriptive question	ive posted alot of questions about my back problems on here. but i just cant seem to find out what is going on with it. so im going to get into details as much as possible. i believe it may have been caused by a football injury that sprained two ligaments in my neck and bruised my collar bone, but im not sure. i hit the ground with a big impact and nearly knocked myself out. the first thing i said to my friend was that i was hurt, i was in a huge daze. of course i was talking about my head injury though. a few months after the injury i started having issues with my right shoulder and back. on the same side where i had landed on my neck. it feels like everything is jumbled together on that side. ive always had bad posture, but i can grind my bones together on the right side and i cant do that on the left side. ive had tingling in my back, to the point where i thought someone was actually touching me on the back and id turn around and look to see who it was. ive had pain shoot through my stomach and private area, very sharp pain, all my joints get stiff. ive had pain shoot through my lower back in my butt area. and sometimes i can even feel my face tingling. idk what this could be. someone give me some advice please. ive already had x rays that didnt show anything, is it possible that just bad posture can cause all this? it just doesnt seem right that my right side is like it is.	right shoulder|lower back|back|face|collar bone|stomach|bones|sharp pain|pain|x rays|grind|touching|said|tingling|right

DEMO	Please Help	Please help. I have had a vaginal infection that has spread to my anal region for over two years. I have seen over 5 doctors and 2 gynecologists and no one can figure out what is wrong with me. I have even had my family doctor tell me IÃ¢ € ™m crazy, and that I donÃ¢ € ™t have an infection because the test results do not show anything.I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend at the time and the next evening I starting feeling burning during urination. I commonly had bladder infections, so I went to my doctor for antibiotics. After taking my medication it was still not gone. I was treated for yeast, bladder infections and bacterial vaginosis on multiple occasions but it will not go away. IÃ¢ € ™ve noticed that with some antibiotics my symptoms lessen, so I believe it is likely bacterial. In addition, I have a vaginal discharge that is a whitish, yellow color with an odour to it (not fishy). I believe it is an STD because the odour from my vaginal discharge is the same odour that my partner had. The outside skin becomes irritated and itches from the discharge (when I have my period and wear a tampon the symptoms lessen). I was given corticosteroids but they only relieve the symptoms and when I use it too often I end up with a yeast infection. IÃ¢ € ™ve had pap tests, vaginal swabs for STDs, urinalysis and even a skin biopsy but nothing shows up. Through the two years IÃ¢ € ™ve had about three or four bladder infections, but with medication my vaginal symptoms do not disappear. I just want it to go away.	bacterial vaginosis|bladder infections|yeast infection|infection|STDs|STD|vaginal discharge|symptoms|burning|skin biopsy|vaginal|anal|antibiotics

DISE	Concerned my son may have OCD.	Hi, I have a 8 year old boy and he is obsessive about his clothing. I know lots of kids like to wear what they want and look nice but he is different. This started very early, I would say at 2 he would already dress himself and he would insist on wearing like 4 shirts and 3 pairs of jeans, he would even double his socks. This progressed to where by 4 and 5 years old he was wearing maybe 8 or more layers and would have huge meltdowns over having to take some of them off. (he even did this during warm weather which was concerning to me) I literally have a video of him laying his clothes out for his nighttime bath and he put like 6 outfits in the floor and then took his bath and comes out and forces all 6 outfits onto himself and then went to bed. Oh and thats something else is he wears his clothes for the next day to bed every night shoes and all. Instead of dragging him out of the toy department I drag him out of the clothing and shoe departments. Now that he is older he don't layer as much but he is very stubborn about dressing appropriately for weather. He wants to wear shorts everyday to school and will cry the whole morning if I make him wear jeans. He gets very stressed when picking a new pair of shoes or pants out because he can never find the perfect one. The shoe laces have to be a certain length and the pants have to fit perfectly, not too long or short but purfectly along his shoes. He just seems to obsess over everything he wears. He will not wear a perfectly good pair of jeans if they are slightly too long or are a little loose. The shoe lace length drives me nuts because he can never get them tied where the loops are the same size so I have to tie and re tie every morning or it is a meltdown before school. Does this sound at all like OCD or am I a paranoid parent. I guess I should say I have 2 other kids and they do not do this.	layers|layer|bath|fit

PREG	Any advise please..	Normally, I have a 28-35 days period cycle and it will last for 4-5 days. I've had my last period on January 13. My period hasn't come until now so I'm delayed for about 2 months already. I had tried doing PT a week after February 13 and done it again on Feb 29, all turned out negative. All I'm feeling now is the same symptoms that I'm getting whenever I'm gonna have my period, like cramps in the back side. I don't have tender or swollen breasts but it feels kinda itchy which is how I also normally feel whenever my period is coming. I'm feeling a bit sleepy when at work but I think it's because I am always not getting enough sleep ( I always sleep around 2am-2:30am and I wake up every 7am) which also I think is the reason why I'm having some slight head ache. I'm not nauseous, not craving for any food and eat the same as always and not vomiting. What I noticed before was that every time I do something new in my routine, my period will also be delayed. And at that time, after I had my last period, I had changed my routine,. I've been drinking (alcohol) for a week (I was on vacation at that time and haven't been really drinking for 5 mths)..I've been exercising every night from 11pm-12:30am, take a bath at 1am and sleep at 2:30am or 3am for 3 weeks.. then a week after, I changed my routine into swimming or skating after work from 8PM-9PM, take a bath at 10PM then sleep at 2:30am or 3am and waking up at 7am. As I remember, I had this sticky yellow/white-ish discharge especially whenever I'm dehydrated (Sometimes, I don't have the time to drink water when at work except for lunch). I'm really confused. This is the first time that I was delayed for 2 months.. Tomorrow, I'm planning to have another PT and if it's negative, might see the doctor on weekends.. I'm really not expecting a baby, so I'm hoping it's just the hormones playing up. Please tell me if u encounter the same. :(	getting enough sleep|head ache|symptoms|nauseous|cramps|breasts|back|bath
SOCL	Why did my boyfriend talk this way about our daughter?	"My boyfriend and I we have a three year old daughter and sometimes he makes sexual comments about her saying things like ""she has the same sexual organs as me"" or ""if you were with another guy he will touch your daughter"" I really don't like it when he makes remarks like this about her it sounds to me as if he will abuse her sexually if she was ever to be left alone with him. the things he says are not normal things a father should say about their female child. It makes me think like he can't be trusted with her and when I ask him to stop saying these things about our child he claims he is just kidding around for fun and when I tell him that that's no way to joke around by saying these things about his daughter he starts laughing and he has said he wishes his daughter lived with him. She lives with me and my parents but he occasionally makes threats to kidnap her and says he wishes she lived with him. I ask him why he says these sexual comments about his daughter he says 'cause it's true"". One day he was visiting with his daughter and as I stepped away from the room for a second I caught him staring at her in an unusaul way and he has a bad look on his face. And he did not know I was watching. When I asked him why he was staring at her like that he said he wasn't he said it was just my imagination. But how can I make him stop saying these things about our child and I don't think the child can ever be left alone with him cause of what he says.

He said for an otherwise healthy young patient like me, the side effects might not be bad.    I can stop anytime I want without consequences.    It will likely fail.    At that time, we can take up on antivirals.I don't know if 8% is worth a year of trouble.    My main concern is the CNS effects of interferon.    I have 2 very young children (a kindergartener and a 10-month-old) to take care of.    Will the depression/irritability/anxiety affect my relationship with them?    Will I be able to take good care of them during the treatment?    Should I just take the antivirals?I will see my dr and another 2nd-opinion-doctor in Dec.    Before that, I want to be very informed so I can make the best decision.    Please advise.    Thank you.	treatment|said|std

I am not supposed to get my period until the 22nd or so, but when we had sex was right when I was ovulating, do you think I could be pregnant? That would have been too early to be implementation bleeding right?	cramping|right
FAML	agressive behavior	My son Ashton just turned 2 years old. he has been extremely energetic since before birth! he rumbled and tumbled in my belly all the time.    I am a stay at home mom.    I always have had to chase him to change his diaper, clothes, and put his shoes on.    Now, he has been very agressive with his sister and stepsisters in the past few months. He will hit them for no reason at all.    He has a puppy that he obviously loves very much but he holds her so tight from her neck ( not choking her purposely) , pulls her by her ears, and when he is done he throws her.    His dad and I try timeout, scolding, and yes sometimes spanking or a pat on his hand when he pulls the girls hair. We have tried talking to him and telling him nicely that what he is doing is not nice and that he should apologize but he never stands still long enough for us to show him the difference. NOTHING works!    We are at our wits end, we have gotten kicked out of places because of his behavior and are quite embarrassed when he screams and throws a major temper tantrum.    What can we do? what is the reason he could be acting this way? oh and he DOES NOT like to share! please help!!!Stressed out mommyThis discussion is related to2year old's agressive behavior.	discussion|choking|ears|hand|hair
PREG	The Appointment We Have Been Waiting For.....U of M update	"Ashtyn had his appointment at U of M today! We started at the very beginning starting with my quad scan being really high and worked our way to the present. After giving all of his history the doctor started asking questions about him and his development, whether i thought he knew his name, and things like that. Well, she started looking him over and she began by telling me his ankles have a lot of resistance and that he has VERY tight muscles. She said that he needs to be in physical therapy immediatly....to the point that if Early On can not provide one, I need to hire a private physical therapist. Along with that, we are being refered to a feeding specialist at the University of Michigan feeding clinic. She said that he has a tight jaw, and she wanted to know VERY DETAILED information about how well ashtyn eats, what he can handle, what he can't handle and where they suggest we go from here. She also looked very shocked when I told her that Dr. Cameron said that he had a substance in his urine that causes kidney stones...and told me to get the results of the repeat urine test to her immediatly. Next, she asked me if he ahs ever been diagnosed with a lazy eye. She said his left eye points inward (which is evident in some pictures) and that I need to take a picture of him to the opthamologist and have him look into it. She said to give her a week to get ashtyn's records of his MRI, Blood tests, EEG, and BAER. She said at that point, her team will review it and see if anything looks odd to them or if anything stands out to them. At this point she will call me and we can create a plan of action and decide what tests she is going to run. She did say that she wants his MRI repeated at 2 years because the brain matures a lot between now and then and that it can show substantal damage that his current MRI did not show. But now on to the part that blew me away.....When we went to Dr. Cameron, he asked me about 10 times if I was POSITIVE there was no history of mental retardation in the family. Well, I kinda blew it off but today the new neurologist asked that same thing. I told her no so she asked me if there was any history of learning disabilities or seizures and I said no....at this point, she looks at me straight in the eye and says, ""There is no easy way to ask this, but is it possible that you and baby's father are related?""....I was FLOORED! I told her absolutely not!!!! So basically, he looks mentally retarded to his doctors and they think it is genetic. So basically, we are waiting to have more tests done, but I just can't believe she thinks it is to the point that she would ask if he is the product of incest!!!!I will keep you guys posted."	diagnosed|left eye|scan|seizures|ankles|kidney|brain|lot|jaw|eye|Blood|said|physical therapist|physical therapy

DISE	Odd sensation in big toe	Hello. I am a 22 year old female, have diabetes since I was about 6.I first noticed this odd sensation in my right big toe about 6 or more months ago, and it seemed to go away until about a month ago, it started back up.The feeling, it is really hard to describe, it's like a buzzy, humming feeling, but very faintly. It's not constant, happens every few seconds. No pain at all. It seems to not notice it when I am pressing on it or moving it in some way.I have had back pain on and off since I feel down a flight of stairs in 2003, resulting in a 2nd degree sprained ankle.I was wondering if a back injury like a slipped or herniated disk, or any other type of back injury could cause this sensation. Or if anyone else has had this, please let me know, I am very anxious and have been worried about it.	diabetes|herniated disk|big toe|back|pain|right
DISE	Microcalcifaction and implant	6 Months ago I was told that my microcalcifications had changed and a stereotatic biopsy was recommended.    After 45 minutes on the table the radiologist said he had to abort due to the close proximity of the implant.    I am going for another digital mammogram next week and if any more change I was told I will need a surgical biopsy.    My surgeon mentioned things about having to be awake while they put needles into my breast and then they would send me down to him where I would be cut and he would try to follow the needles for samples (but he could see implant too so as to avoid rupture).     This needle part sounds painful???    Is this the case.    I had two regular needle aspirations at time of stereotatic biopsy and those hurt alot!    Thet put the needle in to numb me and waited all of 1 minute to go in and aspirate.    I am sort of scared and wanted more details on a surgical biopsy for microcalcifactions with an implant.    PS- my mom died at 36 of breast cancer so I do want to be thorough.    Thanks.	surgical biopsy|part sounds|implant|45 minutes|1 minute|painful|breast|cut|said

PREG	Any suggestions?	I am starting to drive myself crazy.    I am now on day 40.    I went to the re for bloodwork and of course it was negative.    She said my proegestrone was up but that could also mean I ovuated later than normal.    I am usually a 28 day cycle and so even if I did ovulate later wouldn't I have AF by now?    I thought I started to spot yesterday but now today there is absolutely nothing.    If I don't get AF by Tuesday she wants me to come in for another bloodtest.    She won't give me anything(provera) to bring on my period because the progestrone is still elevated.    I have no symptoms of pregnancy or AF.    Can anyone relate to me?    I am going crazy because I am so anxious to start ivf and I need af before I can!!    Any suggestions would be appreciated!Thanks,Lisa	symptoms|said|pregnancy

FAML	preschool issues	I'm really worried about my 4 1/2 year old son.    He's very bright and has the ability to be attentive and participate and make good choices.    In the beginning of his preschool experience, he was really acting up.    At the time his class went through 9 different teachers.    As soon as there was some consistancy and discipline, he settled in fine.    He was really doing good up until a week before Christmas when it all went crazy.    He started running from his teachers and talking back at home and yelling and hitting and throwing.    I'm trying everything, even counseling and help from the local intermediate unit program.    He went back for the first time in 2 weeks today (Christmas break) and although I had no bad notes, he still didn't earn a sticker like most of the other kids.    I'm worried about Kindergarten next year and being called into the principal's office.    I'm a teacher and I don't want to see him lose out on all the good because of behavior.    Please help all you parents out there...if you had behavior problems with a child at school, how did you cope and redirect?    Taking things away at home does not work and neither does rewarding the good days.    HELP!!!Thanks so much for your time.	counseling|yelling|back

SOCL	Discussion Topic: Spouse / SO looking over phone/laptop/etc	"One of the dicussions I have seen on the forums since I have started posting and a repeat topic is Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Husband/Wife looking through others phones.    Being an computer system admin one of the topics recently in the news and I think is important is the reading of your spouses email.My Goal with this thread is to open discussion with members here.    To take everyones thoughts and dicuss so that it isn't discussed in other threads that the OP wants help with their relationship question.    There is no right or wrong answer it is your thoughts.My thoughts on the subject are that once you get married while I understand some want privacy their shouldn't be anything on your phone, email, or other messaging that really your spouse shouldn't be allowed to see.    I completely feel that the term privacy really is one of those things that while you should have from others the person you are married to shouldn't be allowed to see your email or other things.For example if I talk to my parents about things going on in my life then does it matter my SO sees those emails?    Not really it doesn't hurt me at all.    Would I get touchy if the subject was a negative chat about her then yes I could see not letting her see that.    If I am texting mindless babble or daily talk to an ex or a friend of the opposite sex then what harm is their for her to see it?    To me the outcome of seeing such messages is moot.    Nothing happened while I want you to trust me that nothing did seeing that nothing happened is a step towards showing you it was mindless babble.Where I disagree with some is the line of privacy.    This only really applies to married couples as dating really doesn't in my book qualify for the level of lifting the privacy veil if you will.    Though in matter of open disclosre I as a dating person freely opened up my email, fb, etc to my ex-gf because I had literally nothing to hide. The reason I disagree is that if we are married then I view it as its ""our"" phone ""our"" life ""our"" money ""our"" is the word.    Mine doesn't really play in marriages.    For example when was the last time your spouse wouldn't let you look up their underpants?    The most important private parts of our lifes is what is under our clothes. Your spouse will have all the rights unless you specifiy otherwise to make medical decisions for you if you are unable to and access to the accounts and social security number.    So why is it that the email/text/etc is offlimits?There is an old saying... A lock keeps an honest man honest.    I agree with that. If you know that I could check your email or your text messages are you less likely to cheat?    It is true that if someone wants to cheat they will (speaking from experince both personal and having helped professionally).    To me though you throw a moneky into things when you start being protective of your phone or email when I am married to you.    I have a right to know what is going on with our money, our bills, our house, our cars, our ""everything"".    Unless you are working where a job requires you keep stuff secret (Military, Medical, Lawyers, etc) to which those things have nothing to do with me.    Where does the line matter.    Can you really have open and honest communication when someone is hiding things?    Human nature will be to find out."	discussion|rights|right
GOAL	How do I know if I can wait?	"I went to an opthalmologist, about a year after I found out I had the beginning of cataracts. A quick visit, and he said that I wouldn't need glasses after my surgery,and might as well have it now to enjoy great vision.    I postponed the surgery as I was going out of the country for 6 months and I could see fine. Upon my return, he said that the multi-focus wasn't for me as I was too specific, or a perfectionist and I'm used to enjoying sharp vision, and that I would end up wearing readers.    He wouldn't engage me in further conversation, he said ""Toric in one eye to correct for astigmatism, and a standard in the other.    I had asked for a refraction before I saw him, he didn't discuss those results with me. The vision in my right eye had changed (the worst cataract) but what I don't understand is that without my existing R. lens, I see better than with my    glasses. My vision intermediate and distance in that eye seems much better without my glasses. If what the Tec told me (that my vision is worse) and that they could bump up the power in the right lens....why am I seeing clearer with no correction at all?So, I don't know if I can wait, or how bad the cataracts really are. My distraction are halo's and night driving.Is that enough to go through with the surgery. I'm all ready to go in 10 days. Should I just do it sooner than later.The Dr. and Tec's say...why wait, they'll just get worse. There is some risk, and I hear that floaters can appear.I suppose I could get another opinion, but then who do you believe. This is suppose to be a top notch SURGEON."	astigmatism|said|lens|distraction|right eye|eye|Tec|right|correct

GOAL	White cut on tongue - Ulcers - Sore when swallowing - Any ideas?	I've been recently been having some problems with my mouth and on my visit to the doctor, he didn't really know what it was and just gave me some steroid cream for some ulcers.Basically I woke up this day last week and my tongue was rather itchy, checked it out in the mirror and I had a small, but relatively un-noticable bump on the side of the tip. In a day or two it'd become a little sore and I started getting 4-5 ulcers on my bottom lips and now one in the corner and one on the upper lip. The bumps now fully visible, as its turned white, and a relatively big cut is visible where it was just a little bump before.I've also been having hot and cold flushes, which I put down to getting a cold / flu, as well as swollen glands in my neck. I've been drinking as much water as I can, but in the last few days it feels like razorblades are going down my neck as I drink and the top of my mouth has been starting to hurt as well now. The cream the doctor gave me, hasn't seemed to do anything, and if anything, the outside of my lips have become more evidently ill as they've become a darker red and look like scabs yet just feels like dry skin.My gums seem a bit swollen and more sensitive than usual as well.My diets probably not the best atm, but sadly, it hurts to eat anything solid. Also, not a smoker incase it matters.Does anyone have 'any' clue what it may be that I have so that I can tell my doctor so perhaps I'll get the right medication on my next visit?	upper lip|lips|cut|dry skin|flushes|sore|gums|ill|tongue|flu|right
FAML	5 year daughter - hitting etc	I just found out that my 5 year old daughter told a dear friend that she didn't want to be her friend anymore and threw a rock at her.        I also learned that she has been crying at school and having difficulties with other kids.     When I address this with her, she told me another girl at school was having a birthday party and she wasn't invited.    Basically rubbing it in her face.    She also stated the birthday party was going to be at Build a Bear and I just found out that is not true.    It is going to be at her home.        I had my daughter write a letter of apology to our dear friend and express how threwing a rock at someone is unacceptable.    I also address how her feelings are hurt by not being invited to the birthday party and we would not want hurt others.This is such unusal behavior for by daughter.     In her preschool class last year she never had a problems and was invited to the other kids birthdays.I am so upset by this and concern.    I would never want my daughter to physically or emotionally hurt another child.        How can I make sure she doesn't hurt another child and how do I help her deal with being left out?	face

FAML	3 year old preschool behavior	Hi there.    I am having some dificulties with my 3 year old daughter and her preschool class.    She has never been to any type of care before.    This year my husband and Ithought it would be a good idea to enroll her in a preschool program to have her introduced to a little structure.    It is 2 half days a week.    Tuesday and Thursday.    First of all, my daughter is a very strong willed girl, she has begun a stage where if I tell her to do something like put something away she will say no I'm not going to-then she goes to the corner and finally she will comply.    I don't know if this behavior is normal, she is my first.    It seems to be from talking to other parents and from what I read online.    What I think is not normal is her behavior at school.    The teachers explain her behavior as non-compliance-it seems that she just doesn't want to listen to what she is being told, like she has an issue with authority.    She will kick and scream and has even kicked a teacher!    This behavior is not something that we have witnessed at home.    She will of course have temper tantrums from time to time, but she has never tried to kick us before!    The preschool is very willing to work with her.    But this morning when it was time to go to school she kept saying that she doesn't want to go and that it is scary and her teachers are scary.    On one hand I think that she is saying that because they are telling her what to do and she doesn't like it.    And if I pull her out it will reenforce her not wanting to be disciplined by others.    But my gut is telling me that she isn't ready and she is acting this way because she feels uncomfortable.    I just don't know, she really is a good girl and for the most part listens very well at home.    Her behavior at school is very shocking to us-I hate for her to feel like she is being the one that is different-but why would she act this way?    Is she really just being a spoiled brat (shich I don't think she is, but of course no parent ever does) or is there something else to it?Thank you for any help~	hand|gut|act|little structure

SOCL	Dull sudden pain on corona of penis	The next day after having sex with my wife for quite awhile, I noticed there was a very dull pain (sensation) on the left side of my penis, pretty much on the corona.    This dull pain will suddenly appear and last for a second or two and I noticed it is more common while moving and wearing clothes.    The sex did last for a while and there was a lot of rubbing and I suppose friction to that area (my wife knows that is the most senstive part of my penis).    Is this just of matter of friction and irritation to the area and just will take some time to go away?    This has been occuring for about 3 days, and it does not really hurt to the touch or when I have an erection.    Any suggestions?    Thank you.	dull pain|penis|lot

It is quite high under my top left eyelid, I tried pulling my top lid over my bottom lid, no luck. I don't really want to drive to the doctor, as my eye keeps tearing up and may cause a collision. If I look far to the right when I blink, it doesn't hurt, but I imagine it's still bad for my eye.	safety glasses|grinding|left eyelid|eye|right

Accompanying the loss of sensation includes extreme migranes(migraines)and joint and muscles aches (like hit by a bus).    Most of the pain seems to be on the right side but does hurt all over. He is not a fan of taking pain medicine and has taken limited - when needed only! All doctors look at him and say that's interesting but nobody has determined what the cause is. It is not the cause of an accident that we know of or of a bump on the head or anything like that.	right side of head|cheek|face|tongue|aches|pain|head|ear|and muscles|right

GOAL	Swollen lip after front root canal	I got my first root canal yesterday on the very front left tooth ( i think it's tooth 7? ) and it went perfectly fine, my dentist said it went perfectly fine, and to take some iBuprofen when i got home and the vicoden i was perscribed when i went to bed. I got home at 3:30pm, took 2 tylenols, and around 6:15pm the left side of my face started throbbing (much like it did when i found out i had to get the root canal). I had an infection also above my tooth which I was given amoxicillan for and I took it, but the bump didn't go down all the way so she gave me more amoxicillain to continue to take until next friday when she puts in my permanent filling rather then the temporary I have. At 6:15pm I took a vicodin which didn't help at all, then between 8pm and midnight I'd taken 4 tylenols at different points - which didn't help at all either. So without wanting to take more meds, I just lay in bed til 5am without being able to sleep and decided to take a second vicodin which seemed to help and I zonked out.This morning at 7:15am I woke up with a very, very swollen lip. It's only swollen on the side my root canal was done on but the bump seems to have either gotten larger or gone down because I can't feel it as a bump anymore. It also feels to be kind of numb.I asked my grandmother who's had a root canal and told me to put ice on my lip, which I am, and that it should be a normal thing because it's not normal to get a root canal and it probably just made my mouth mad at me. I want to know if this is normal or what should I do. Thanks!	swollen lip|root canal|ice|infection|said|tooth|lip|face

PREG	Could I be having a miscarriage?	"Hello,I am expecting my period on the 26th of July (I suppose that's a day from now considering it's passed 12 AM), and I received what I thought was my period mid day on the 24th of July (Yesterday). To this moment the flow has been very light and the color of the blood has been a dark brown color (Thick in consistency). I'm 20 years old and am currently taking an oral contraceptive. My boyfriend and I engage in sexual intercourse at least 6 days a week. My concern is with the color, consistency and flow of my ""period"". So, I have been adamantly searching the internet for the last hour or so and have found many possibilities for the cause of my strange ""period"". Miscarriage, implantation bleeding (early pregnancy in general), several worry worth medical conditions, and even just the simple possibility that my period has come a few days early. I have been experiencing symptoms of early pregnancy, such as: tender breasts, emotional sensitivity, light to mild cramping after achieving orgasm, headaches and fatigue. However, many of these symptoms also occur about a week prior to my period. At this point I'm just concerned, there's no place open at the moment where I'd be able to get a pregnancy test so I've decided to seek knowledge here. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.Thank you."	early pregnancy|Miscarriage|conditions|pregnancy|light|tender breasts|headaches|symptoms|cramping|implantation|color
DISE	voice loss	"On December 23 I had surgery to clean out my left side carotid artery. As a result I probably have a great artery. Trouble is when I went to talk there was nothing there, I had a really sore throat and put it down to the thing they stick down your throat. However, 2 months later I barely have a voice and the sore throat is still there, I also have sensations running up my head from my ear to the top of my skull, nobody has given me a definitive reason for this. My family doctor believes the laryngeal nerve was damaged and has put me on neurontin, helps every now and then, the voice will strenghten fo 2 or 3 hours and then ""poof"" it's gone again. The ent says it's GERD, put me on nexium, so now I know my stomach acid pump has been dealt a blow, still no voice. The cardiologist that did the surgery says ""wait it out"" blood did get into the larynx, so HMM. Nothing fits though with a sore throat, the sorer the throat, more elfin the voice. Now, I do know a bundle of things I do not have (had quadruple bypass in May of 2008) every organ, every other things you have in your body are fine, I did have 4 mini strokes, caused by a 90% closed carotid, but there was no brain damage, I do not have cancer anywhere, so I should be happy right, well I am, but no voice, constant sore throat, doing my part for the economy by keeping Halls afloat.

TRMT	Estrogen and B6 Toxicity	I've had B6 toxicity for almost a month now.    I'd read, on this forum, that B6 absorption may be reduced by the estrogen in foods.    Although I realize that the comment was about food, I wanted to investigate the estrogen angle.Especially since my neuropathy symptoms improved so much during my period.    And I'd read some accounts where neuropathy was worse prior to period onset (when progesterone is higher).Anyway I tried using estriol last night.    (Estriol is a bio-identical estrogen cream.)    Wow, did my symptoms worsen!I was on day #10 of my cycle.    And, if it matters, I'm in my late 40s with a regular cycle.Does anyone have any information on what's going on?    Or on how estrogen impacts B6 levels?    Has anyone had any experience with the use of natural progesterone or estrogen with B6 toxicity?    Prior to this, I frequently used natural progesterone during the last part of my cycle (day #12 thru day #26).    I hadn't touched the stuff though still dealing w/ this B6 problem.Thanks	neuropathy|symptoms
SOCL	Cant find specific topic? lightheaded upon waking before even sitting up and rising?	"In the ""ask a doctor"" forums, I could not find the specific category that lightheaded/vertigo would be under. Maybe that can be a new category? My quandry is this; First of all, I am a 50yr old male 5'5"" and 155lbs. I'm B-12 Anemic that requires monthly IV shots. I have had a real bout w/ Cervical Radicilitis a few yrs. back. Also have much artery plaque build up. I do have probs w/ inner ear wax impact that simply does not drain naturally that requires regular vacuum or irrigation, but ENT does not feel that is a cause of my dillema. I haveI read the first five years of community comments in general forum in regards to folks describing there lightheaded dizziness symptoms to each other and gave up continuing further, so my inquiry possible answer or solution might of been posted in more recent comments. I related to much of the descriptions of there symptoms but in the first 5 yrs. of comments that I read, I saw nothing as to my specific inquiry. Here it is as follows; Many times over past few years I wake up very lightheaded. Comes and goes. Usually at least once a week. Sometimes 2-3 mornings in a row. Will last maybe up to 45 minutes as it gradually fades. THE REAL KICKER is that the feeling is there upon waking but before I even sit up? It is aggravating cuz when i've mentioned this to various docs over the past couple years, they seem to just shrug it off and say something like ""thats interesting"" or ""i don't know why that would be"". I know that I should of been more assertive with the doctors regarding the matter. Thanku to any who might read this. regards matt nordquist"	lightheaded|dizziness|symptoms|irrigation|drain|45 minutes|inner ear|plaque|Cervical|back|ENT|artery

Now, she moves at night, and I wake up sometimes to kicks, but it worries me because I REALLY have to concentrate to feel anything during the day.I talked to my doctor about it, and she is sending me for a scan on Friday. Also because my doctor thinks I might have low amniotic fluid because my 'belly bump' is on the small side. Her heartbeat is good, and movement has not completely stopped, but I don't know what to do.I've been feeling kind of crampy, like I have to use the washroom or something. And my back has been hurting on and off. I don't know what is going on. This is my first child, but my doctor keeps insisting I wait until Friday.	crampy|scan|back

GOAL	General problems and weird thing	First, if it will help, I'm 23 years old male and i'm not wearing glasses.I have some problems with my eyes and want to know if they could lead to problems or not.* I see floating things while moving my eyes (lines, worms, ...)* If i gazed at the sky (morning), i can see many small points moving in all directions.* Happened about 4 times when i was tired and concentrating on something, I saw points moving like the ones i see in the sky but they were orange or red. This happened without looking into a direct light and I was sitting in a moderately lighted room. (The first time i saw it, I was like I'm screwed a devil is appearing :D)* Even though noone realizes it, I have misaligned eyes. I asked a doctor ones but he laughed :(. It is very clear in photos. And when i move my eyes to the extreme left side, my right eye hurts but if i move them to the other side i don't feel any pain in the 2 eyes. The right eye goes to the extreme left before the other reaches it.* In one eye i have darker eye lashes than the other. Sometimes i think one eye has dropped cause of that. I don't put any thing on or near my eyes (noticeable in pictures). (It doesn't matter that much just if it was a symptom for a disease)The weird thing is that i can make the view blurred infront of me willingly from when i was a child and return the view back. I used to tell my brother that i'm emitting a radiations :). I don't use my hands or anything and i don't even move my eye balls. I know it's not a super ability; I'm just wondering if it is experienced by others and why is that?	right eye|symptom|tired|pain|worms|lighted|lashes|light|hands|eyes|eye|back|radiations
FAML	5 year old boys	My best friend and I both have 5 year old boys.    The other day I walked into my sons room and his pants down and my friends child licking his bum hole with his pants off.    As soon as I walked into the room the boys turned around and nervously pulled their pants up.    I brought them outside and asked my friend to come over so we could talk without the dads or other children around.    My friends child got so upset that he had to be put in the car and just kept saying he didn't want to go fishing.    I talked to my son and he said his friend pulled down his pants and started to lick his penis and then his bum and then visa versa.    A similar thing happened about six months ago and we all had the talk that clothes stay on when they play and nobody touches anyone in their private parts.    My friend took her son home and we talked to our son but is this a normal thing?    I know children are curious but this seems a little disturbing to me. Please advise.	penis|said|nervously

DISE	Heart Disease	I'm a newbie here on the heart disease site and not very sure what is going on.This all started with my getting    sick and going to the ER thinking that I am having a heart attack.    It turned out that my potassium was very low and my glucose level was low.Prior to this ER episode,    my potassium level was hovering around 3.3 for about 4 months.    At the ER it    was 2.6!I had been on HCT 25 mgand Diovan Hct 320/25 mg for about 2-3 years.    My primary doctor took me off the HCT.I had an appointment with my endocrinologist prior to this.    I advise the dr what took place with the ER and my primary.    The endo doctor then took me off the Diovan HCT and started me on Diovan so that i could take a renin and aldesterone tests.Does the potassium have anything to do with the thyroid and why did the endo take me off all diuretics to take the two tests.With not being on the diuretics, my body was retaining fluid rapidly that I started to look like the pillsbury dough girl. Now,I have gained about 8 pounds since my doctor took me off all diuretics. Went back to my primary due to the swelling and was told that I may have possible congestive heart failure.    He then sent me to a cardiologist.    The cardiologist wanted me to do a nuclear stress test ASAP. Not sure of a dx per the cardio.I have asked but no one will tell me that I can go back on the diuretics so that this fluid can go away.    I am miserable.Everything hurts to the touch.    If I walk from my home to the mailbox, I start wheezing and coughing.    One night I though I was drowning in my sleep.Today I went for my nuclear stress test and they gave me no answers, just told me to wait for the cardio.    I ask one tech what I was being tested for and she said cardiovascular disease.    Now I'm really lost.Thank you in advance and would greatly appreciate your responses.Terri	cardiovascular|back|heart attack|said|disease|coughing|heart|body|Today|fluid

DISE	I can't do anthing I enjoy or care about.	I am a 17 year old boy, and I have lived with severe OCD for about 7 years now. Looking back at these years now, it feels like I've been living in hell, and I've made my mum's life very very difficult too. I am very dependant on her to constantly validate my choices etc. My OCD has surfaced in many different and incredibly painful ways, which would take a long time to explain, but more recently I have had one difficulty in particular that is making life a horrific chore each and every day. I recently got a job as a kitchen porter at a local pub, and it really relaxed me and allowed me to enjoy life more (probably due to being too worn out from hard work to overthink anything), but then over the last few weeks all of that has changed. All I want to do when I get home is play on my new Xbox, watch a good film or read a fantastic new book I found. However, my OCD does not allow me to do this. It manipulates my mind into thinking I've put the disc in the trey wrong, blinked too many times in the opening title of the movie, or not read an important passage from my book thoroughly enough at a critical moment of the story. Everything else is horrendous enough, but at this moment I am solely distressed about the Xbox and book situations. The Xbox cost me pretty much everything I've earned since I got my job, and I cannot play it as I had a few uneven hairs on my newly shaven head, and therefore could not enjoy the opening of the box, and therefore was filled with regret when I started playing a game, and therefore could no longer play it. Ã‚ £250, it cost me. And now whenever I try to play it, I completely freak out and have a horrible physically painful pit in my stomach. My book, which I was thoroughly enjoying, now has a horrible tainted feeling about it because I did not read a sentence properly and now cannot go any further without constantly thinking about that moment. And then even though I can completely see that what I am fretting over is ridiculous, and has no logical reasoning to it, that does not help in the slightest. It's self-perpetuating. ie: I can't read it any more because I can't read it any more. Also, these things are so much worse on my days off work, as my mind has more energy and is free to be as conflicted as possible. I am so so so so so so uncomfortable in my life. EVERYTHING I do I second guess. I obsess over how other people can enjoy the things I can't. And the worst thing is, even if I completely saw the error of my ways and felt way better about the individual things, that day is still tainted to me. As soon as I have a thought it becomes a physical object to me, blocking me from doing anything I like, anything that will give me some distance from everything else I have to freak out about every day. And then when I think of those good, positive things, they feel negative and bitter. I actually have to sing to myself very loudly sometimes to try and block out negative thoughts, because once I have thought them, that it for the day, that's it for anything I'm doing, that's it for contentedness for the near future, until I've struggled to explain these thoughts to my mum and we talk it out, because once they're there, they're there. I am literally in a prison inside my head. I am surrounded by wonderful people and the most loving family possible, and all of these luxuries and great things, and I can't enjoy any of them. I know everything I've described worrying about sounds totally trivial, and it is, and I know that, but nevertheless they are what my OCD has targeted and is using to try and destroy me from the inside. All I want is some relaxatiom and relief from the pain I'm always feeling, but my mind does not allow that. If anyone has anything that they think could help, I would be overjoyed to hear it. Thank you very much for reading. X	painful|pain|stomach|hairs|head|back|severe|manipulates|chore
DISE	Will I ever get my life back again?	I've been diagnosed with Overactive Bladder.    I, personally feel that I have an infection that is just not showing up.    Not only do I have the constant need to urinate.    There are times when I go to the bathroom every 20 minutes, and the amount is fairly large.    After this, I get pain in my kidneys.My urologist tested me for everything possible.    He finally diagnosed me with Overactive Bladder.    What baffles me is that every time they test my urine they find a trace of blood.    Does Overactive Bladder cause blood to show up in the urine every time?I'm about to try the fourth different medication.    I'm hoping this one works for me.    I feel as if I'm    ready to lose it.    I'm having a very difficult time.    Sometimes I have to urinate about 30 times a day.    This disorder has taken over my life.I am very irritable, and I find that I can't leave my house because I know I'll be needing a bathroom within a half hour.    Is this going to change?    Is there anyone out there who has had a similar situation, and is now having relief?    Please let me hear from you.	diagnosed|infection|disorder|kidneys|pain|trace|minutes

TRMT	Chronic headache	Hi, my sister-in-law has some brain problem. She has chronic headache and it is very disturbing for her. She looses interest in everything and gets cranky. She wants to get some 4life brain supporting product specifically transfer factor cardio. Is this thing really going to help her ? She was seen by a doctor and was told that she has brain artery shrinkage. Is there any good medicine that can help her not having headache every single day. She doesn't smoke and never had any kind of serious head injury. Thanks	chronic headache|artery|brain

As I'm mentioned in my prior post, I have been through 2 years of breast cancer, followed with breast reconstructive surgery... plus I'm hypothyroid, not a good combination to lose weight!Anyway, no complaints here with the metformin, Yesterday I did have a bit of lose stool but nothing that was really bad or painful. My doctor wants me to have blood work on 8/31 and if it comes back ok she will slowly start to increase the dosage. I am TRULY hopeful ladies that this medication is going to help me!I'll continue to keep you all up to date!Claudia	hypothyroid|diabetes|painful|breast|back|reconstructive
TRMT	Hysterectomy for small fibroids?	Hello.    I have a history of uterine fibroids, and also just found out that I have a ovarian cyst (5.2 x 5.3 cm) in my lower right quadrant incasing that ovary.    My GYN says that will have to come out along with that ovary, which I understand.    However, he says I should have my uterus out at the same time (via laparoscopy) as my 8-10 fibroids have grown 20% in the last year.    I am 45 years old, and although still ovulating, believe that I should hit menopause in the next couple of years.    My fibroids are all relatively small (16mm at the largest), although I do have all three categories (subserosal, submucosal and intramural).    I have read up on both UFE/UAE, and believe I'm not a candidate (more than 5 fibroids, and no truly large fibroids).    I've also reviewed the newer focused U/S, which is again for those with larger fibroids.I'm not sure why I should get the hysterectomy.    I'm mostly asymptomatic for a fibroid patient (my periods are regular, with only two days of regular bleeding and 3 days of spotting; some early cramping that requires a few doses of Ibuprofen only); I had 5 fibroids in the Fall of 2010, neg. biopsy, went on the pill.    Then f/u U/S 6 months later showed 10 fibroids, with the initial 5 larger. Neg. biopsy, off pill (since it obviously didn't help!)    My doctor believes that the fibroids will continue to grow (most likely, but they are growing slowly) and could become cancerous(not usual for fibroids) or necrotic.    He says while in for the laparoscopy for the ovarian cyst and ovary, I could have my uterus out and leave the left ovary.    But he says if I wait, will later have to have a cut-down instead, which is of course much longer in recovery.I'm seeing my D.O. this week to discuss, and am planning to visit an additional OB/GYN for another opinion.    I've also just started on Black Strap Molasses to see if it will help with the fibroids.    I'm trying to hold out until May 14th (after my college class graduates) to have the lap.    My doctor agreed to let me wait but will get another u/s in a month to monitor the cyst and fibroids.    Curious to see if the BCM will show any difference in a month.    Any input?	periods are regular|cramping|lower right quadrant|ovarian cyst|uterus|cyst|May|asymptomatic|laparoscopy|are relatively|left ovary|ovary|cut

TRMT	necessary hysterectomy?	I am a 58 year old post-menopausal woman.    I have a 4.5cm fibroid uterine tumor.    I have had no symptoms, no bleeding.

His teacher says he bothers and annoys the other kids, breaks their lego creations, pokes them to get their attention, likes playing by himself and tends not to sit in his assigned spot on the carpet opting to move about instead.It came to a point recently when he simply didn't want to go to school anymore and wanted to join the afternoon class instead. The problem persists, he is still a loner.What can I do? Am considering Montessori education.Francis, Toronto, Canada	creations|Francis

FAML	Gender Identity in 5 yr old girl	I am concerned about my 5 yr old adopted daughter and her continued desire to dress and act like a boy.    She also wants to be called a boy name instead of her own.    She has an older brother who is 7.    It seems to have progressed well beyond what I would consider normal tomboyish behavior.    She wants to buy boy clothes and requested a short haircut that looked more masculine.    She will only play with boy toys (Star Wars, trains, etc.) although she doesn't appear to even enjoy playing with them.    She will only play with boys at school (kindergarten) as well.    She also has adopted boy mannerisms like wearing her hats backwards, standing with her hands in her pockets, wanting to wear thick masculine chains for necklaces, etc.    This has been going on about a year or so and her father and I dismissed it initially and have pretty much let her dress the way she's wanted within limits.    We have begun to wonder if there is anything we should be doing to either address it or just let it run it's course.    Please advise!	mannerisms|hands|act

FAML	Discipline for a 3 year old?	"I have tried time-outs, he throws his time-out chair clear across the room.    I have tried sticking to my guns and putting him back in the chair, back in the chair over and over and it just fuels his little fire.    I have a 10 month old baby as well, and when my husband is at work I can't be neglecting her, to put my son on a time out for an hour.I've tried turning the microwave on for 2 mins and telling him he cant move until he hears that beep but then it becomes a game and he will jump out of the chair laughing while I chase him to put him back and then I start cracking up because he has a really great laugh then....just like that discipline is out the window.Each time he does something he shouldn't be doing, we tell him that it's not nice and explain why.    His usual reactions are either bursting into tears and crying, or screaming NO.    he has also got into the habit of doing something he shouldn't do (like try to take our daughters hairties out of her hair which always results in him pulling her hair) then immediately saying ""sorry sorry sorry sorry"" afterward because we always make him apologize to whoever after he's done terrorizing them....so its kinda gotten to a point where...He feels like or thinks he can get away with anything as long as he says sorry...I don't know what else to do!    I've tried googling this, and asking friends everyone just says the same thing ""Time-outs, and informing him about what is right and wrong..."" I constantly tell him whats right and wrong and nice and bad and all these things, I am a stay at home mom and I spend ALL my time with my babies...I don't even remember the last time I had a babysitter lol...anyway, Other methods of discipline/teaching/shaping my child to grow out of this!BTW my son is an amazing little guy and I feel kinda bad about writing here but I am just reaching out for new ways to help him be a better little man."	back|hair|right

Approximately three weeks ago on this very website, when I was starting out here, a woman came to one of the communities, I can't remember which one and she said she was thinking of committing suicide because of reasons I do not wish to share. Anyway, I wanted to give her some advice about what to do and so I read the article. After reading the article, I was amazingly emotional. She was young and lost and she felt she had no support. I was emotional and, now take it easy:My response had swearing in it.My main emotion, unlike many other people, is anger not sadness and so, yeah, in my response, I sounded like one hell of an angry old man. Of course the swearing was never directed at her and I was reassuring and heartfelt in my response and anyone who reads it would understand what I mean. I do have common sense, sympathy and compassion when I am writing these things. But either way, I felt like I was wearing the tag ""Worst Human Being on the Face of Planet Earth.""So a couple of minutes after writing the post, I went to her profile and posted two notes. One begging and pleading with her not to make the wrong decision and giving her some more heartfelt and reassuring advice and another begging and pleading her to write back to me, good or bad.It has been three weeks, I have done what I can, my original post with the language in it was deleted by a someone other than her. She still hasn't responded and it appears that she still hasn't interacted with her profile. I am only sixteen and I want to do whatever I can to help people.

DISE	Aneursym	Hello Everyone,I joined this forum I guess for some sort of support and I    know it does sound desperate. I am aged 34 and my dear mother died at aged 42 with a condition that is not listed on this website . The condition is Cadasil and recently found    out I have the condition , my younger brother has the condition and my remaining brother and sister have chosen to not be tested due to age and preference.    I am now going through the stage where I was informed that my children will have a 50% chance of inheriting due to it and have been offered PGD . I guess my condition is closely linked to Alzheimer's. My mother died as a result of a brain hemorrhage and it was fatal and been advised that is the way the condition can affect and also causes a serious of strokes. I am now getting loads of headaches around parts of my head and terrified when i get pins and needles and feel like I am having one . Does anyone know of the condition much ? I guess I just want to have children and be able to live to a decent age and see them grow up. I recently went for a serious of tests and was advised that due to my lifestyle that I am quite healthy , my cholesterol was quite low at 4 and my bp was textbook and that I was quite healthy so nothing to worry and to keep reporting any changes of symptoms so can be thankful of that.	pins and needles|headaches|symptoms|condition|Alzheimer|strokes|brain|head

GOAL	Mrs	Hi,I am in a wheelchair because of a crushed t7.    I have severe asthma that sometimes is 'exercise induced.'I have Type 2 Diabetes and Epilepsy.    My doctor told me that I am over weight.    I weigh 70kg, 162 cm tall and my waist is 97 cm.I go to a gym for 1 hour twice a week and spend 1 hour at a physiotherapy class - balance/rehab.    I try to motivate myself to do exercises at home (I use a Fitness Coach program on my Wii), but no matter how much I exercise, I can't seem to lose weight.    I find it difficult to go on diets as I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome and multiple food sensitivities.Also, I am steroid dependent (7mg daily) which stops my muscles from growing strong.Can you help me please.    I would like to lose at least 10 cm from my stomach, if possible.    Thank youYours Trulypooiddlebum	exercise induced|weight|weigh|Type 2 Diabetes|Epilepsy|Syndrome|physiotherapy|exercises|crushed|balance|stomach|waist

GOAL	Crown prep on a tooth with irreversible pulpitis?	As I have written, I have a molar with a large temporary filling that has been showing signs of irriversible pulpitis.    I went to a 2d dentist to get an opinion on treatment v. extraction & implant.He said it will need crown lengthening but he still thinks it's better to try to save the tooth (he thinks in this case CL won't interfere with future placement of implant if/when needed).    BUT he said it's possible there's more decay he can't see under the temporary filling that would cause him to recommend extraction instead.He wants to remove the sedative filling and see.    If no additional decay, he'll prep the tooth for the crown and I'll get endo 1-3 days later.    Otherwise extract.    He said he doesn't do any endo including emergency pulpotomy.My concern is, won't the prep on an already sensitive tooth (I'm on regular advil and tylenol to keep the pain at bay) be almost certain to give me horrific pains until I can get endo done?    If I need to get an emergency pulpotomy to manage the pain until I can get to an endodontist, how much can I expect that to cost?	crown lengthening|sedative filling|treatment|pulpotomy|implant|endodontist|pulpitis|decay|said|molar|tooth|pains|pain

The one warm haven wher others could relate to what they were going through.I'm terrified of people who act as if they are godly when they are masking their evil personalities.I'm shocked that people can overlook their similarities, the common bond that brought them together, and focus on religious differences to set them apart.Maybe this should have been subtitled the ""Believe as I Do---or I'm leaving"" forum.Or maybe, in light of what has transpired: Let's bring our friends on board and take cheap shots at someone waiting for a transplant.This forum has set a new low.....Congrats to K and G!

SOCL	Fox Nation, Rush Limbaugh Peddle Gay Marriage-Pedophilia Link	"Fox Nation joined Rush Limbaugh in promoting a bogus link between support for same-sex marriage and the acceptance of pedophilia.During the January 7 edition of his radio show, Limbaugh referenced a National Review Online (NRO) column, which criticized an article in The Guardian for highlighting the growing debate over whether pedophilia should be classified as a distinct sexual orientation.Limbaugh - who has previously accused the ""gay lobby"" of trying to downplay cases of child molestation - attempted to link the growing acceptance of pedophilia to the campaign to legalize same-sex marriage:LIMBAUGH: There is an effort underway to normalize pedophilia... I want to take you back. I want you to remember the first time, wherever you were, that you heard about gay marriage, and I want you to try to recall your reaction -- your first gut reaction -- when you heard that some activists or somebody was trying to promote the notion of gay marriage. What was your initial reaction? ""Aw, come on. It'll never happen. That's silly. What are you talking about?"" There is a movement on to normalize pedophilia, and I guarantee you your reaction to that is probably much the same as your reaction when you first heard about gay marriage. What has happened to gay marriage? It's become normal -- and in fact, with certain people in certain demographics it's the most important issue in terms of who they vote for. So don't pooh-pooh. There's a movement to normalize pedophilia. Don't pooh-pooh it. The people behind it are serious, and you know the left as well as I do. They glom onto something and they don't let go.[...]Now, there were people -- I just want to remind you -- back during the early days of the effort to redefine what a family is, and in the early days of the gay marriage activists, there were people who said, ""Well, if this becomes mainstream, then someday marrying your dog is gonna be okay, and then having two husbands and two wives in one family is gonna be okay, 'cause who can say it isn't?""    There were others who predicted that pedophilia would be mainstream, and there was an outcry of opposition to this.The same NRO column appeared on Fox Nation, along with an almost 14-minute clip from Limbaugh's radio show:Fox has a history of attempting to tether pedophilia to LGBT equality. Fox's resident anti-LGBT pseudoscientist, Dr. Keith Ablow - who is a member of Fox News' ""Medical A-Team"" - has previously criticized the American Psychological Association (APA) for ""caving into cultural pressure"" to destigmatize homosexuality and pedophilia. And last August, Fox's Bill O'Reilly defended the right-wing smear that child molesters are more likely to be gay.Fox's promotion of Limbaugh's comments is also surprising, considering that the network has previously supported the idea that pedophilia is a distinct sexual orientation. In a FoxNews.com article, Ablow warned that a person's sexual orientation could be shaped by environmental factors, such as men who become pedophiles after viewing sexualized images of children.http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/01/08/fox-nation-rush-limbaugh-peddle-gay-marriage-pe/192091"	column|Bill|wing|gut|remind|smear|back|said|Fox|right

SOCL	whiplash and hand tremor	My wife and I were in an auto accident in October of 2007. Since then she has experienced subtle yet significant changes in her personality. These changes have been gradual and not really noticeable until certain events began to bring things to light.Not long after the accident she began to notice a tremor in her hands. She does have epilepsy that is controlled with medication and at first we thought they were just related to one of the medications she was taking. But the tremors have continued to worsen and medication adjustments have so far failed to have any affect whatsoever on the tremor. This tremor has made it difficult for her to perform simple tasks such as holding a fork or glass, writing a letter, or typing on a keyboard.She has also experienced difficulty concentrating and often Ã¢ € œsearchesÃ¢ €  for words during conversation. Again, these changes have been subtle, but have nonetheless had an effect on her personal and professional life.She was given a 1st quarter performance review for 2008 today, May 16, 2008, and was quite surprised at some of the things her manager had to say about her performance over the past few months. As a matter of fact, when comparing this review to previous reviews there is an obvious difference in her attitude and her performance.I am not qualified to offer a medical reason for any of the problems that she is experiencing however out of concern I have done research. It has been documented by several medical professionals that there can be a relationship between tremor in the upper extremities and whiplash type injuries. A relationship has also been documented between confusion and fatigue, and whiplash type injuries.    These symptoms do not always appear immediately following an injury and in some case do not present themselves until months later. This has made it very difficult for doctors to diagnose and properly treat the symptoms.With all of these issues she has become depressed and I am afraid this is only going to make her situation worse. If we are not able to find a solution to her hand tremor and the bouts of confusion I fear she may lose her job.Her doctor doesn't seem to give any credibility to the research I have presented and I am not sure where to turn for help.Thanks for any advice.	treat symptoms|adjustments|upper extremities|hands|and properly|hand tremor|symptoms|tremors|tremor|confusion|epilepsy|May|light|diagnose

DEMO	PLEASE HELP!!!	I have been seeing a physician for what was diagnosed as supraspinitus tendonitis and carpal tunnel in my left shoulder and left wrist since 7/20/2012.    I go back every 4 weeks and keep getting told to stretch and avoid things, i.e. lite duty at work, where it started in the first place.    I have had pain and numbness, enough for me to see a doctor on my own for the first time in years, only to be told to see another or workmans comp won't pay.Since 7/20 I have had a variety of issues, after having nothing more than a cold or mild flu for at least 10years.    I have had a rash (thought it was hives, got Zyrtec, got worse, was given methylprednisolone) The rash was red welts that started as a few then escalated and faded then came back again.    Was advised this was scabies as of 9/17, with a diagnosis from and LPN and Dr at the same facility.    I was given permythrin(sp?) to use that day then 1 week later.    Spots faded, then seem to comeback everytime I get wound up or nervous.    Took a nabumetone 10/23 (prescribed for shoulder) got spots within 4 hours.    This leads me to believe I am allergic to NSAIDS, which is why I thought I got 'hives' in the first place.Today, the w.c dr. starts telling me he thinks I have an underlying issue that is preventing me from getting the shoulder back to normal.    He acted like I omitting something or lying to maintain a lite duty designation.    He suggested I may have lyme disease or a rhuemtalogical(sp?) situation.    He said he would see if w.c. would cover diagnostics, not sure what was meant by that.    I have insurance if they won't, he knows this.    I was interrogated for an hour about what he thought may be symptoms, most of which I could attribute to birth control usage, work fatigue, being tired from an erratic work schedule, f.t. job plus f.t. school.Yes, I agree this is all strange to crop up after having been fine for years.    Yes, maybe its odd that it took 5 years at a job before I had an issue.    No one else has been to him from my job, but mind you there is another choice of dr, so he wouldn't see everyone who complained, as well as I work equipment that only 2 people work so my issue would be likely attributed to the work.I need help, ladies, I'm not sure what to do or think.    Supervisors at work think I need to see the other dr., but I am forboden from the facility as my other half does not like the dr there and doesn't want me to be subjected to his quackery( has been sued and lost more than once, but maintains a license)    I don't know if I should rush to my usual dr and have a lyme test or what.    I know since I have been to the appt today I seem to have some welts cropping up, leading me to believe I did not ever have scabies (also odd that the man that shares my bed never got them especially odd since I allegedly had them 6 weeks before diagnosis) Does anyone have a similar issue?    These stay itchy for several days. up to a week, generally on my torso and arms.    I was advised that hives don't show up because of nerves, then what are these things.    I have never has this issue before this summer.    I don't use drugs or smoke or anything.    I have vivera retainers at night, which I received 7/13, wore for 2 months then down to nighttime as of 9/5.    These have an allergy warning, but since I didn't have a problem with invisalign, I feel the retainers shouldn't be a factor.I know this is long, thank you for looking, I need help because I have no one to help me and this forum seems to be very active and knowledgeable.	left shoulder|torso|back|arms|shoulder|lyme disease|tendonitis|scabies|hives|said|flu|left wrist|cropping|carpal|nerves|crop|diagnosed|diagnostics|symptoms|nervous|welts|Spots|spots|tired|pain|rash|stretch|Today|active|methylprednisolone

During appointment my daughter did ""perform"" for us: she did have one of these episodes of moro reflex during appointment. Doctor said it is most definitely the moro reflex. Also prior to appointment we did EEG which was also normal. Her development is also normal (as per her pedi at 6 months appointment). Now my question. My daughter still has a moro reflex even though it does appear less profoundly than, say, 2 months ago. But it still there. On all websites it says that if moro reflex is present after 6 months (which technically my daughter is not yet) that means there is a profound neurological defect.

We saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks 3 days.    Yesterday I went back for a routine follow up ultrasound at 8 weeks 5 days and found out the baby died a week and Ã‚ ½ ago.

FAML	22 months old boy eat little to nothing	"Hello, I have a 22 months old boy who has been hard to feed since he was 7 months old. His weight started from being average, to lower percentage, and right now around -5%, and it worries me very much because he looks skinny and his weight is around 22 lbs right now. Me and my husband are from a country from east asia, and we are very small (5""3, 125 lbs). The ped suggested me to feed him more cheese and milk + vitamins gummy bears, which is what I have been doing for 2 weeks, and to my joy he gained 1.5 lbs, until the last 2 weeks hecaught a cold and completely lost his appetite.

SOCL	Pregnancy paranoia	I have been on birth control pills for over a year now, currently am taking Levora.    However, last month I delayed my period by taking extra pills which left this month's pack a little short (with 16 active pills instead of 21).    My doctor told me to jsut finish out the pack with the 16 active and then on to my 7 placebo so that I do not mess up my cycle any more and so I did that and got my period during my placebos and then started my new pack.    About 5 days into the current pack, however, I visted my boyfriend and since I did not know if my protection was compromised from the shortened pack earlier, instead we had anal sex one night... and since everyone tells me that semen can leak from the anus to the vagina, I put vaginal spermicidal gel into my vagina in case that happened and the second night we used a condom (which had no sign of breakage) and vaginal spermicidal gel.    We are both STD/HIV free, recently tested and very monogamous.    However, I hate that thinking that my BCP was not working because just using condoms and spermicidal gel has me concerned since they seem not as effective.    What is the effectiveness of using those combined? And was my protection with the BCP compromised? I could never get ahold of my doctor in time to ask her and my pharmacist thought that I would be considering I had my withdrawal bleeding and then went on to my active pills so I am just really confused and now concnered.    Thsi was just yesterday so I still have another few weeks before my next period and I don't want to be scared this whole month.	birth control pills|placebos|placebo|shortened|withdrawal bleeding|vagina|STD|vaginal|anal|anus|active

DISE	Gallbladder?Gallstones?Diverticulitis?IBS?HELP!!!	"Some months ago, I was told that my CBC stated my liver was slightly enlarged. Though no signs of Hep. And a otherwise normal CBC. So the DR sent me to get a u/s series(liver scan) and that was the last I've been able ""test"" or see the DR. Its super hard to get an appt. No insurance. ;(However, it wasn't UNTIL then that I began to notice issues with my upper right quadrant. I am a MA and I know a bit about this stuff. I suspect my gallbladder, though upon looking at my results and speaking very briefly with a urgent care DR, my results are all normal. He says if anything was wrong w/ my gallbladder it would have shown. He said he suspected a muscle strain. But I beg to differ seeing as its been months and it still happens.My symptoms are as follows: sharp, short pains under the right rib area at no particular time of day, sometimes I feel like something in that whole area is ""throbbing"" or ""shaking"", and shortly after I eat meals or during meals I almost feel as if the right side is ""growling"" as if my stomach would. The pain has never led me to take any pain relievers. It truly isn't that bad. Its very bare-able seeing as they are so short and just periodic through the day. I notice certain symptoms more than others.And I should probably state the following: I am a ""obese"" 26yr old, otherwise always in normal good health. No high cholest. or diabetes. I have diabetes in my family however. As well as diverticulitis and diverticulosis(i think its called?!). I have been diagnosed with GERD/HeartBurn however, I am able to keep that under control very well. I lost some weight and the problem relieved itself. I only have to take anti-acids occasionally. No other meds needed for it.Also, only twice now I also got a sharp pain in my actual stomach, but under the rib area as well(almost identical to the same area on the opposite side) which I always thought may have been my acid's acting up again. Could it be possable I have a over-active acidic issue? Or do you suspect the gallbladder as well? No one has ever had their gallbladder removed in my family. I suspect it may be IBS too...my bm's have never been normal. I have one about every other day to every two days. My dad is the same..its just how we always have been.Anywho, I hope I painted a clear picture and included any info needed here. Either way I know it is my digestive system. I know I am not on the best diet, but I drink tons of water...tons. Some insight on what to do next or what you may suspect it is, would be most helpful. Thank you so much."	sharp pain|symptoms|shaking|pains|pain|upper right quadrant|right rib|stomach|liver|rib|diagnosed|scan|diabetes|obese|said|GERD|diverticulosis(i|as diverticulitis|active|right|enlarged

DISE	People with Flutter in upper Stomach - Read	All,I have been having attacks for about three months now. They have been predominantly physical symtoms(symptoms)in nature (Sometimes when I have a physical symptom it scares me into anxiety or panic). Physical symptoms: flutter of stomach / esophagus, weakness, fatigue, blurry vision, weird sticker pains in stomach, etc. I noticed my digestion seemed to slow down during the recent attacks. I intiially thought that I was just constipated from taking nexium (Yes like many of us I have acid reflux). At one point I was losing my appetite and bowel movements have become sporadic (some hard - some loose). i went back to the GI doctor and he tried to tell me to get my anxiety uder control and eat more fibre - I told him something was wrong and literally forced him to schedule me for the barium x-ray of the upper GI and to plan a colonoscopy. Against his will he did so. I got the call from them - I have an inflamation(inflammation)of the bowels and they want to do the coloscopy and take a biopsy. From what I read it means worst case is Crohn's disease of Ulcer colitus (sp?) - not fun things but treatable. Either of these leave your body short of nutrients which can bring on all the symptoms above. You may want to have this checked.	physical symptom|constipated|symptoms|weakness|pains|acid reflux|Crohn's|disease|stomach|bowels|body|back|upper GI
PREG	Miscarriage Help	I had a started having a miscarriage on January 9th, 2011. I was actually pregnant with twins, and passed to really large clots. There were a bunch of smaller clots that came out as well. I bled for what seemed like forever, but it eventually stopped about two weeks later. Actually it was defiantly a little over two weeks. Well I started bleeding again on February 8th, 2011. I thought it was just a period. But then I read that you should have a period no earlier than 4 weeks after a miscarriage. And that you should go at least 20 days with no bleeding. I am still bleeding, from this so called period, Tomorrow it will be 2 weeks that I have been bleeding again. I just want to go on with my life, but I am having this constant reminder of what I lost. Is this normal? What should I do? I can't go to the doctor, because I don't have health insurance. I don't feel any pain, and there is no offensive smell coming from me. Any and all advice is appreciated!	pain|reminder

I went to the dentist yesterday and wa told i needed them out and that he didnt think i had an infection, but gave me clindmycin just incase. He said it is more likely the pressure from the tooth. My question is, does this sound like an infection or just major diacomfort from the tooth??? The dentist seem to be a quak so I dont know much, other than I need them out.

Our problem started 3 days ago, when she started crying between 5pm and until she falls asleep, with short break for bath. She used to cry when i was bathing her, but now she looks like enjoying it, after i put her to get dressed after bath she starts svreaming pretty badly, and i can't stop it with anything.I'm sh-h-h-hying in her ear and she stops for 30 sec., then starts again, and finally stops and falls asleep. I'm trying to calm her down to feed before night, but she doesn't even care about that after all that crazyness.

I've until recently I've just had a buildup of filling material on it, but about a month or so ago, I had a crown done. I was VERY pleased with the result - you cannot tell the difference between the real and the crown.Now though, I've discovered that if I run my finger between the gum and the crown, it smells of decay. When I had the crown done, I wondered whether it might be possible that the tooth stump could rot underneath the crown, but the dentist said crowns are too precisely made for it to be possible. I trust his knowledge, but thought I should maybe check online before visiting him again.Thanks for any help you have! :)	finger|tooth|decay|said

Also, he knows how to tie his shoes but he will pull them ask tight as possible and half way through he will stop , undo everything and start over. There are times it takes 10 to 15 mins to get his shoes on and tied. He is EXTREMELY particular about his clothing and refuses to wear anything that is ""new"" or different.

DEMO	Yeast infection or something worse?	About 5 days ago now I was using the bathroom and it burned not when peeing but when pee trickled on the area between vagina and butthole which caused me to yelp. I just thought it may have been a tear from rough sex. after that i would hesitate when going to bathroom because it burned in that spot everytime. the next day while going pee my whole vagina area burned and caused me to tear up. after enduring the agony from using the restroom i looked with a mirror to see what it is exactly. And there where small red bumps almost rash looking around my butt hole and vagina. I called to set up appt expecting to go today. i have a little discharge from time to time. Thinking its a yeast infection ive been using monistat and it sooothes the pain for a while but comes back after a few hours. after showers and oatmeal baths    when looking with mirror all sores look very red and painfull and now the skin area between the vagina and butthole is swollen and feels very uncomfartable.. Ive been using the cooling cream from time to time to give some relief. I'm scared of what this may be. any ideas.	yeast infection|vagina|rash|pain|painfull|back
FAML	Behaviour concerns - a dissorder or just naughty?	"I wonder if anyone can offer any advice?? Obviously I adore my son - he is a very loving boy, and bright and when the mood takes can be just perfect. However more increasingly his behaviour is a concern of mine, my partner's and his school and in the back of my mind I have always had concerns he may have behavioural problems from some kind of dissorder because his father has problems - he is a manic depressive and has an anti-social dissorder. I have depression on my side of the family also. His father and I separated when our son was a baby.I will start with listing my concerns as this might make it easier -*At 8 he is still wetting himself, even though he is constantly reminded and denies needing the toilet when doing what my partner and i call - the wee dance*Very unorganised - ALWAYS losing things, cant remember where he put something within a few minutes. Forgets what he has been asked to do within minutes or gets distracted.*Obsesses about 1 particular thing for a month or two at a time and will talk constantly about his chosen subject ie a computer game or tv programme - will interrupt conversations at inappropriate times asking questions or telling us about his subject.*Ignores us when we call him and then replies with ""attitude"" after we have called him 2 or 3 times.*Is bordering on speaking to us disrespectfully, rolls eyes when being told off.*Acts in an inappropriate manner when playing - plays dangerously swinging items around, playing on the road. going out without permission or telling us where he is going.*Lies to get out of trouble and says what he thinks we want to hear - not his genuine thoughts.*Says inappropriate things in conversation - as if trying to joke but not understanding that his joke is innapropriate ie said in a desrespectfull way*He is very clever but struggles to show it as struggles to get things down clearly on paper or sometimes even explain without getting distracted in his thinking pattern.*He can be very negative about himself and is very sensitive - i have to be careful what i say around and to him making sure it is not something that he could feel responsible for uneccessarily.There are just some of my concerns - some more serious than others - but these are constant and daily and really grinding myself and my partner down. They are having an effect on his schooling and they are currently putting steps in place to test for dispraxia. I have had suspicions of adhd/add but the school had dismissed the idea.Is he just unruly? I am not a ""soft touch"" nor am i too harsh with discipline. I dont smack and always explain for what I am disciplining him and how if discipline is neccessary.    I have a ban on obvious bad behaviour triggers such as fizzy drinks etc. I just dont know anymore if it is just him being naughty or something more. Are there any other dissorders that could explain my sons behaviour? As he is getting older I am finding it increasingly difficult to be as patient with him as I used to and not knowing whether it is just naughtiness or something more just adds to my frutrations.Sorry for the essay! Please can anyone offer any kind of explanation? Anything that could help my son would be very greatfully recieved , thanks."	reminded|grinding|minutes|finding|back|eyes|swinging|said|inappropriate

DEMO	Implantation or weird period?? help.	Hi. I was hoping I could get some insight here. My bf and I have been together for over 10 years. We have unprotected sex regularly. I was on the pill for 15 years and went off of it in September and have been getting my period every 28-20 days with no issues. I was supposed to get my period @ 1/28, but it came on Friday 1/22 - about a week early. It only lasted 1.5 days, was dark and only required 1 tampon (not full) per day. It stopped on Saturday and then today it seemed to resurface, but again it was dark and light flow. So strange. Just wondering if this sounds like implantation bleeding or just an irregular period. Thinking I'm going to make a stop at the pharmacy today...Thanks so much for any help you can offer.	implantation|It stopped|light
DEMO	I know this is not a fertility ?  But I cant afford 16 bucks to Ask else where..	Back in April.    To be more specific On Good Friday.    I had to endure the most painful thing.    I passed some kidney stones.    I got through it and assumed that would be it.    Little did I know that just this past Friday I would have to endure it again.    Now it is Monday and my back still hurts.    I went to the doctor on Friday when I knew that I was experiencing the passing of the stones.    After I was feeling pretty good he sent me home and told me to drink plenty of water and to come back this week.    I went this morning and my back was still sore.    He ordered some blood work.    And scheduled a CT.    I go in the morning for it.    The pain in my back was so uncomfortable I had to leave work.    I have vicadin but cant take it at work.    I work with machinery.    When I spoke to my doc he told me that there where 18 spots or something to that effect in one of my kidneys.    Should I be worried.    Do any of you know weather or not I am going to have to pass these.    He also made the statement that we might have to take care of some of these.    I really dont want to go through this again.    It is compared to going through labor.    I never have I had a c-section with my son.    Can any of you give me some insight on what    to expect?    I would like to go in knowing something rather then nothing.    Thanks a bunch.    Kristine	painful|spots|sore|pain|kidneys|kidney|Little|Back|back
FAML	I don't know how much more I can take	I have been married to an alcoholic for 7 years.    He is 47 years old....he has been drinking since he was 16.    When I married him I had NO IDEA how much he drank...but he has recently admitted to me it's a 5th or more of Vodka per day.    He wanted to go to the doctor (3rd try) to quit drinking...so I took him.    She put him on Librium.    He hasnt been drinking for a week...his legs have suddenly swollen to double their size.    I am feeling guilty because when I met him he was such a good looking, vibrant, healthy ( or so I thought) man....now he is beginning to look 10 years older and you can tell he's not healthy.    He refused to let the DR do his liver enzymes....says he doesn't want to know.    When he's sober....he is the MOST wonderful man to me....we are so much in tune....he's my best friend....and I love him..but after about 3 p.m....when he starts hitting that spot of drinking that turns him...he is so cruel and i have never experienced such meanness.     If this time doesn't work....which I'm sad to admit here I don't think it will...he realizes he's killing himself but can't stop the drinking.    I don't think I can stay here anymore...I'm so tired of feeling like i'm walking on egg shells and that i'm throwing away the best years of my life...working around when he's going to be a mean drunk or a happy drunk....	shells|legs|tired
FAML	8 year old girl temper tantrums	"Someone please help me understand my daughter!     This morning she woke with a sore throat and runny nose. She was not running a fever so, I gave her aVitamn C drop and sent her to school. On our way home from school we stopped and Rite Aid and I bought her some over the counter medicine. In the car she began opening the medicine. I asked    her to stop and to please wait until we get home so I could read the box and see how much of a dosage to give her. She replied, ""I'm not stupid, Mom!"" and threw the medicine bottle on the floor board of the car. When we got home she grabbed the bag of Vitamin C drops and took off to her room. I followed her and asked for the bag back reminding her Vitamin C drops are not candy. She threw the bag across the room and threw herself on her bed yelling at me that she is not stupid, she knows they are not candy and she only wanted two of them. My husband entered the room and told her not to yell at me. My daughter said, ""I'll yell at her if I want to, she allows it!""

My Mom and Husband say to whip her and at times I feel like it, but does it solve anything for the long term? She also gets in trouble at school for talking and impulse issues..getting out of her chair.    Why is she so angry and out of control?    Could it be from the holiday sweets and potato chips?

DEMO	What could this be	Hi,I don't know if anyone can help me. Ever since i've gone off the pill...my cylces are somewhat irregular..sometimes it's 28 days, then 26 days, then 33 days, etc.    The shortest cycle has been 25 days and the longest 33.    But lately i've noticed that i sometimes (not all the time) bleed after sex and also some certain poistions (deep penetration) are really painful.    what could be causing this?    My first thought was endometriosis...but i'm wondering what else could cause it.    A friend of mine said it could also be gonorreha or chlamydia (that's what she had with these symptoms), but i don't think it's an std..i've been married for 2 yrs. and neither i or my husband have been unfaithful...plus when i get yearly paps...i'm pretty sure they check for those things...i'm due for my pap in a couple of months anyway.    Otherwise..i have no symptoms and my husband and i are ttc again (i had two miscarriages)...will this affect ttc or could it be a reason why i miscarried.    sorry to ramble...but i'm really worried...my ob/gyn told me not to worry and since i don't bleed everytime after sex, etc it's nothing to worry about (maybe time for a new ob/gyn?)    Anyway...thanks for any input.	endometriosis|said|std|chlamydia|symptoms|painful
DEMO	dermoid ovarian cysts	"Im 41 years old and have 1 child. I went to a gyne in Oct. because I hadn't had a period since July and I knew I couldn't be pregnant. She found a small cyst around 2cm as she was doing an transvaginal US. She said she thought it was a dermoid, which didn't have anything to do with my lack of periods. She said the cyst was strange. There was also alot of thickness. She had me come back for another t/us in a month. In this sono the cyst stayed the same size and appearance. She said she didn't feel it was cancer because of small size. Now she wanted me to get a second opinion at the hosp.a few days later. They did both    abdominal and transvag. US. The nurse said the results had confirmed gynes diagnosis. I asked her if it was a dermoid and she said yes. The results said ""Tiny amount of free fluid in pelvis. Within    right ovary there is a 1.7x1.2cm cystic structure which demonstrates internal echoes and has a slightly irregular appearance to its wall anteriorly. Color doppler application does not demonstrate blood flow within structure This probably represents a hemorrhagic cyst. Limited color doppler application: demonstrates normal appearing arterial waveforms bilaterally. Impression: slightly complex cystic structure measuring 1x7cm which probably represents a hemorrhagic cyst."" They recommended a followup sono in 6weeks.Although,my gyne wanted a followup sono in 6 months. What does the results actually mean? Is this a dermoid or a hemorrhagic cyst?why wait 6 months?Is removal of cyst necesaary if stays the same size and appearance?

FAML	3 yr old Granddaughter complaints of pee pee hurting	My granddaughter has been complaining at nights that her pee pee hurts that she feels like she has ants in there.    Its has been so bad at nighs that my daughter has taken her 3 times to the emergency room.    All the urine test done come back negative. An ultra sound was done and come back negative. the only thing they have come up with is Pin Worms.    They have her two pills one to take at that time and the other one in two weeks this was last weeks end.    they told us to give her benadryl for the itch and    motrin for the pain.    This was only happening at night but now its starting to have earlier in the day.    Last evening it was so bad my daughter gave her the other pill just in case the eggs had hatched and thats why is was getting so desperate.    My granddaughter was so happy a couple of days ago she said Mom my pee pee does not hurt anymore only a little bit with a big smile on her face.    Until yesterday she said the ants are back. Her pediatrian says she does not know what it is.    The urologist the same.    Please help!	Worms|said|back|face|pain

DISE	I was drugged and possibly sodimized...	I had a situation almost four months ago where I was drugged and possibly sodimized... By the time I went to the doctor (two weeks later) I was too ashamed to be specific about what was going on, so I just had all the std tests and went on my way... But I really wanted to ask about the problem I am having with bowel movements.I have always been a little constipated I guess, and so at first I didn't think it was a big deal, but now, four months later I am still having a lot of trouble.    A bowel movement the other day was so hard to get out that I was almost in tears and there was bright red blood in the toilette.    I dont poo more than a couple times a week as it is... and this is the really gross (sorry) part...I actually feel full... Like all the way to the opening of my anus... So the other day in the shower, while cleaning I poked my finger in less than an inch and there was hard poo all the way to there... just sitting there... Shouldn't that passageway be clear?    Excuse my biology ignorance here... But I dont think that is normal.I'm afraid it may be from some possible activity that night... Could I be damaged by any anal activity that may have taken place?    Should I be worried?    I am taking XLAX to try to help me and it doesnt even work!Thank you	constipated|finger|anus|anal|lot|std
FAML	My 5 year old is going nuts	"My son's father and I have had joint custody since we separated and divorced. My ex-husband got married and started a family with his new wife, and I am living my life, but we kept joint custody of the child. About two months ago I picked my son up from my mother's house (she used to watch him until I got off of work) and took him home. He was acting funny so I decided to put him to bed early. I told him to take off his shirt to put his pajamas on and his back from mid-back down past his but was full of welts and bruises. I took him to the hospital and they pressed charges against his father because he told the doctor and police officer that his dad had done it because he was mad at him. Now my child lives permanently with me as the judge placed a protective order against his father until the criminal court date.....I feel this back-ground knowledge is important. And I have taken my son to counselors here, but they don't seem to care, and tell me his behavior is normal.The behavior is this: he screams, he is defiant, he cries over everything, and he throws tantrums. For example, if I am helping him with his kindergarten homework, he screams because he just KNOWS that I am not right, and then he starts crying. If he's drinking a juice box and says he doesn't want it anymore and I tell him to go ahead and throw it away he will start screaming and crying like I'm trying to take it from him. If I he said the sky was blue and I told him ""yes, you are right"" he will start screaming and crying. It doesn't take much, and since no therapist or counselor will say this is ""not normal"" then something else must be going on.    I mean, I spend time with him and get on his level to sit and play legos, but in the end he ends up screaming about it, and crying. And the crying doesn't just last a few minutes, he will do it for up to an hour.Would love some suggestions."	throws tantrums|welts|back|order|said|right|minutes
FAML	4 year old boy plays with penis	Hi, my 4 year old boy plays with his penis while watching tv or just while he's talking to me or lying in bed, I think this is normal. The thing that bothers me is that he has become quite fond of it in a humorous and maybe vulgar way, he pulls down his pants and makes strange child like humorous noises while using his penis as some sort of guitar! He thinks it's funny, I try not to laugh(I did at first but not anymore)and just ignore him. He also points his bum at me and stretches his cheeks apart to show me his anus. he does these things in a vulgar humorous manner, but I can't get him to stop, do you think he will grow out of it?He has got no older siblings so he has got these ideas on his own, unless perhaps it is from nursery. The main thing is I don't know how to handle it, do I tell him it's not funny or just ignore him or punish him and tell him it's ugly. At the moment I just start talking about something to try to distract him from doing it.	stretches|penis|cheeks|anus|watching
SOCL	Burning Sensation During Sex	I have nearly always had a burning sensation during sex. It does seem to come and go.    At times it is very intense and even burns for awhile after sex.    Sometimes, however it is almost nonexistent.    I went to the doctor and all she could come up with was a lack of lubrication, however, no amount of lubrication even lessens the pain.    It is a very deep pain, not on the vaginal lips.    I am on the NuvaRing and while it is supposed to be hypoallergenic, I am concerned that it is causing irritation.    Has anyone else experienced similar problems?    If so, what was it diagnosed as and what was the treatment?    I really love my NuvaRing and am praying it is not the cause.	burning sensation|deep pain|pain|diagnosed|treatment|hypoallergenic|vaginal|lips

DISE	SPC reversal	"I have had several spinal operations Li to L5 and C5/6.    Following last lumber op I had severe weakness in left leg due to nerve damage. Severe pain develop and a spinal cord stimulator was implanted by a pain management specialist after a very successful trial.    The actual implant was never as successful as the trial and in an effort to adjust the stimulator the relatively short procedure took over 5 hours and further nerve damage was incurred which has left me with weakness in both legs and committed to a walking frame and wheelchair.    Following this procedure from which I was hospitalised fror 5 weeks I developed bladder retention and ultimately an Supra Pubic Catheter inserted.    I have had the SPC for four months now and am seeing the Urologist in the next few weeks.    I would like to have the SPC removed.    My question is ""What is the likelihood of a succcessful removal and return to normality.    I still have sensation at various times and I would like to have the SPC removed and give my other problem my total attention.""I am approaching 79, am well and fit, being able to walk daily 5km in 23 minutes and 12km in 1 hour at weekends.My present situation is most frustrating."	weakness in left leg|weakness|fit|pain management|procedure|implant|removal|severe|implanted|minutes|Pubic|legs|trial|Supra
DISE	head pain, tremors, swollen lymph nodes	I am only 25 years old and am having a very hard time right now. I have so many symptoms that came on suddenly a few days after a very stressful Christmas. They appeared in this order over the course of a week: migraine, swollen lymph nodes, one very swollen lymph node on right side that became less swollen over the course of a week while on antibiotics, head pain, head pressure, sinus-infection-like symptoms without any congestion, chest pains, irregular heart beat, increased pulse rate(90-100), increased blood pressure (130/90), fatigue, anxiety, internal tremor and sometimes hand tremors. This all began with the swollen lymph nodes, headaches and head pain 3+ weeks ago and progressed to chest pain (which has mostly subsided), tremors, and head pressure now. What gives?The tremors are the most distressing. As well as not knowing what is wrong.I have been healthy my whole life with the exception of kidney stones and have always had pretty good blood pressure, pulse rate, etc.I have considered that it is some kind of viral infection (West Nile?), heart problem (mitral valve prolapse?), or even a thyroid problem (although my tests came back okay). I have a history of panic attacks but I don't think this is caused by that. My Dad was in the hospital for a long time when he was 40 with undiagnosed problems (passing out, seizures) which was eventually diagnosed as Epstein Barr. My doctor is stumped as to what's wrong with me and I am considering a round of anti-viral and nutritional IVs.Has anyone had this happen to them?	head pressure|heart problem|hand tremors|chest pain|head pain|headaches|symptoms|seizures|tremors|tremor|pains|infection|prolapse|Epstein|West|diagnosed|kidney|chest|back|order|antibiotics|right

GOAL	Alarming pain in my back and shoulders and some weird tension in my glutes	Before getting into describing my issues I want to apologize for the long read I just want to be as thorough as possible to get an accurate evaluation. The back pains around my latissimus dorsi I think according to this anatomy chart I am looking at and the shoulder pains are close to my rotator cuff area. I been having shoulder pain for awhile now. I used to only have some pain in my left shoulder when I went up for a military press but have stopped that exercise for close to 2 months now. I don't feel to much pain in my left shoulder anymore but I feel it more in the right side which is kind of foreign to me because I never felt pain there before. This pain has been persisting for like 3-4 weeks now. The pain started occurring    after I took a vaccine. I am not sure if this vaccine is directly related or if this is delayed muscle pain from poor form on some of my exercises. Just today I started feeling this tight tension in my glutes and when I touch it kind of hurts. It feels like a bruise but I haven't worked my legs in a like a week so I don't understand this. When I lay down on my back it feels like I am laying on something don't know if anyone feels similar sensations and when I lay on my shoulder I kind of feel like I have this bump there or something. The sensation in my shoulder has been persisting for 2 days and in my back for 1 day. It hurts when pressure is put on the affected areas.I don't know if this is severe or not but I haven't lifted in 3 days and it feels like it gets worse the more time I take off. It seems like the exercising actually kind of helped with the issues. Normally throughout the day I feel like a burning nerve pinching tingling sensation around my shoulder(don't know how else to describe it) that alarms me but isn't really painful. I have been having this sensation ever since I got the vaccine so its been occurring for like 3-4 weeks. It stopped for awhile but recently just came back. And if your curious I think the vaccine I got was a meningitis vaccine. I don't know how long it takes for side effects to wither away but I am not sure if its responsible for my muscle pain.I can swing my arms around with no pain but when I elevate my arms for an extended period of time I kind of feel some tension in my shoulders but its not really painful. Lately in my back randomly throughout the day when I am    washing dishes or something I been feeling this weird numbing sensation around my lats I honestly don't know how to describe it. I been having this sensation daily for the last week and a half.    But the muscle pain I am feeling is not immobilizing me, I can still bend down and do all my daily tasks. I can still lift weights and exercise if I wanted to but I am refraining from it currently because I don't want to make the injuries any worse. I really don't know what to do about this whether to exercise or not to exercise I am completely unsure.	latissimus dorsi|rotator cuff|legs|wither|shoulder pains|shoulder pain|back pains|burning|painful|pain|weights|left shoulder|shoulders|back|arms|shoulder|affected areas|exercises|and exercise|immobilizing|severe|It stopped|bend|tingling|right

Hello everyone, I'm in a terrible situation and thought maybe a forum like this could really help me.I've been on the Roxicodone 30mgs for about 9 months now and have pretty much been nonstop.I know what all of the withdrawl(withdrawal)symptoms are and I know pretty much all about it but I really need help and encouragement getting off of them.I don't want to get into a rehab or anything like that because I have a fiance and we are struggling tomake it now and it would kill her and bring us down if I had to.What should I expect in the long run?Today I was 3 days clean off of them until somebody asked me if I wanted to smoke one with himso I had about an eighth of the pill and stopped because it's been really making me sick and Idon't even feel good off of them anymore.So, I guess any advice and encouragement would be greatly appreciated.Thanks so much.

PREG	ONE BLOCKED TUBE	Hi everyone - My boyfriend and I have been trying for a baby for nearly two years, came off the pill April 2008, trying ever since, nothing happened so went to my GP, he refered me to a gynaecologist for fertility tests, had a HSG X-ray done which showed that my left fallopian tube is blocked, so then booked me in for a laprascopy - which I had done last week (still recovering!!), which confirmed the tube is blocked, but luckily have no adhesions down there or any cysts - and blood tests show I am ovulating and apparently am fertile.... which I am confused by as I haven't managed to fall pregnant on my one clear tube as of yet!!! Another issue, since i came off of the pill, have had breast milk for past 22 months, and had blood tests which show it's my prolactin levels, (as its hard to get pregnant while breast feeding, so a hormone imbalance).    So my follow up appt is in 6 weeks time and I got told I will be given medication to boost my good tube/ovary to go into over drive and something to dry up this breast milk!!! I got told tubal surgery is an option but i REFUSE to have that done at my age - 22 - as there is a high risk of it ruining my good tube and might end up losing one, or both! And every time you have surgery 'down there' it causes scarring to your tubes, regardless.So has anyone had this problem??? If so, have the fertility drugs helped??? I really want to fall pregnant and have felt so down in the dumps since my laprascopy last week xx	fertility tests|fallopian tube|cysts|imbalance|breast|ovary

FAML	3 years old and not talking	Hey, I have been told not to worry, but I canÃ¢ € ™t help it. My son who just turned 3 does not talk. Not a word, if he wants something he points or screams for it. We are a multi-lingual family, which from personal experience is not easy on a child, but even I started talking before the age of 3. We took him to seen his paediatrician and were told that everything seems to be fine. He seems to understand us in whatever language we use, I can tall him to do something and he will do it. I do a lot of word associations with him, in the hopes that he will say the words. But I feel like IÃ¢ € ™m not getting through, he just wonÃ¢ € ™t talk. His sisterÃ¢ € ™s development was spot on, and she is a very energetic child. She gets most of the attention in the family since she demands it from us. He just quietly follows her. His motor skills are also in question at times; when he walks he stumbles a little, as if unsure about distance. Should I have his eye sight checked?? Could that be a factor in his development?? I am at a bit of a loss, and would appreciate any help. IÃ¢ € ™m just not sure how to best help my son. Thank you.	lingual|lot|eye|demands
PREG	am I pregnant?	"In the end of March my IUD fell out (don't know why)... so me and my husband just thought if it is meant to be than I will get pregnant. April and May went by and nothing, so I called my OB/GYN to get birth control pills, they set up the appt for July 3rd. June is almost gone and I have not had my period. My last period was May 7 and I think I probably conceived two weeks later. On the third week of June, my period was suppose to come but it didn't and I felt ""pregnant"" even before that. But I took two pregnancy tests and both came back negative. I might wait to go to my appt and have the doctor take a test. I have a 3 yr old soon, so I am kinda nervous at the outcome...

I am by far athletic. i have no dizzy spells or fainting spells. i walk at least 5 times a    week. i get my heart rate up to around 140 (and trying to get it up more...but have to take baby steps). i can sit for a couple of minutes after and it is back down between 50 and 60. i am never out of breath to the point i cant talk. maybe a little winded but that is it. my blood pressure is normal...may elevate a little while exercising....140/90. then returns to around 115\75 after i rest. i have brought this up to my doctor and he is telling me i am fine and that i am just worring. i dont think my heart rate should be this low...i am about 100 pounds overweight and i am just starting to be able to get my heart rate up to where it will not throw me into a panic attack. i am a 35 year old woman who does not smoke and takes a small dose of xanax to help with my GAD. (please dont judge my GAD to this question)Thank you for your stories and comments :)	out of breath|fainting|spells|watching|back|minutes
TRMT	Asymmetrical lips	I recently found out that I have asymmetrical lips. Not the upper and lower asymmetry. It's just that the left side of my lip looks normal but my right side is a bit shorter than the left, making it not proportional. Even my dentist thought I was born with cleft lip. It's really bothering me and I'm wondering if there's any treatment for this.	treatment|lips|lip|right

SOCL	Release of Lockerbie bomber a mistake, British government says	"London, England (CNN) -- The British government called the freeing of the Lockerbie bomber a ""mistake"" Friday amid renewed questions over his release.Britain's ambassador to the United States, Nigel Sheinwald, said the government believes it was wrong to let Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi out of prison in August 2009 and return to his native Libya, but it was a decision taken by the Scottish executive, not the British government.Scotland has its own government that is responsible for most of the day-to-day issues there, including the justice system. Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill freed al Megrahi in August after doctors concluded he had terminal prostate cancer and three months to live.The ambassador's statement came a day after the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced it will hold a hearing July 29 to examine al Megrahi's release.Despite that terminal prognosis, al Megrahi is still alive, and news reports in recent days have questioned whether he was as sick as depicted. Questions also have been raised about whether a deal was cut to release him to protect British business interests in Libya.Sheinwald said such speculation is unfounded.Video: British govt.: Bomber release a mistakeVideo: UK oil deal for Pan Am bomber?RELATED TOPICSLockerbieLibyaAl MegrahiUnited Kingdom""Claims in the press that Megrahi was released because of an oil deal involving BP, and that the medical evidence used by the Scottish executive supporting his release was paid for by the Libyan government, are not true,"" he said.Al Megrahi, now 58, was convicted of involvement in the December 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. The attack killed 270 people, including 11 on the ground.He was the only one ever convicted in the case.Last week, a group of U.S. lawmakers called for an investigation into whether oil giant BP may have played a role in lobbying for al Megrahi's release. BP and the British government have consistently denied any involvement.BP said it did express concern to the British government in late 2007 about the slow progress of a prisoner transfer agreement that Britain and Libya were negotiating, saying it could have had a ""negative impact"" on British commercial interests.BP was not, however, involved in any talks with either the British or Scottish governments about al Megrahi's release specifically, the company has said.In an interview with CNN, Shokri Ghanem, chairman of the National Oil Corporation of Libya, denied allegations of an agreement to free al Megrahi in exchange for bolstered BP commercial interests in the country.Scotland also denied any contact with BP over the al Megrahi case. It said his release was on compassionate grounds and was separate to the prisoner transfer agreement.""We were always totally opposed to the prisoner transfer agreement negotiated between the U.K. and Libyan governments,"" a Scottish government spokesman said in a statement. ""The memorandum that led to the [transfer deal] was agreed without our knowledge and against our wishes.""Indeed, the justice secretary rejected the application from Libya under the [prisoner transfer agreement] specifically on the basis that the U.S. government and families of victims in the U.S. had been led to believe that such a prisoner transfer would not be possible for anyone convicted of the Lockerbie atrocity.""Mr. Megrahi has terminal prostate cancer and was released on compassionate grounds alone. He was sent home to die according to the due process of Scots law, based on the medical report of the Scottish Prison Service director of health and care, and the recommendations of the parole board and prison governor -- all of which have been published by the Scottish government.""The fact that al Megrahi is still alive does not change the Scottish government's thinking about his release, the spokesman said. The three-month prognosis was a ""reasonable estimate"" based on ""a range of expert medical advice,"" he said.""As Mr. MacAskill said at the time of his release, he may live longer or he may die sooner, but what is undeniable is that he is terminally ill.""Sheinwald wrote a letter Thursday to Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denying any link between commercial activities and the Scottish government's decision to release al Megrahi.The letter said, ""We have to accept that there is now no mechanism for requiring a person who has been released on compassionate grounds to be returned to prison if they have survived for longer than the prognosis at the time."""	application|hearing|giant|said|cut|ill

PREG	Movement and braxton hicks or contractons?	I am 20w2d today. I feel the baby a LOT during the day. But it feels so different from the movement I felt with my first. It hurts almost every time she moves. It hurts like on the inside of my uterus. Is that normal? Also, every time she makes a big move, and I would say about 5 times a day when she isnt moving at all, my uterus gets really tight and it hurts a little. Is she causing a contraction or braxton hicks. It has been 5 years since my first,so I cant tell the difference anymore. I honestly dont remember having any BH with my DS. I had MANY preterm labor episodes though. What do you guys think it is. Should I be worried at all? Is it normal to tighten up during movement? Or to hurt?	uterus|LOT

DISE	Severe eye allergy to unknown laboratory chemical - PLEASE HELP!	I am currently undertaking a pHd in a microbiology laboratory and have begun suffering from a severe eye allergy to some chemical present in the lab where I work. I first had the reaction at the end of my honors year in the same lab when i noticed slight soreness and redness in both eyes and within 1 hour of these symptoms it progressed to severe swelling, very red, bloodshot eyes, and intense pain, and being firstly unable to close my eyes then progressing to being unable to open them and being very sensitive to light. After seeing several GPs which each gave me different diagnoses and treatments with ointments, antibiotics and antihistamines, I was eventually given the diagnosis of a severe allergic reaction and was taking 1 antihistamine tablet a day which prevented the reaction from returning. I then took a year off and have had no problems with my eyes. I have recently returned to the lab approx a month ago and have had the same reaction again (hence the assumption that the allergy is to something in the lab) and took the same antihistamine and used over the counter antihistamine drops which had no effect. I have been prescribed fluorometholone eyedrops and tobramycin ointment which have cleared up the allergy.I am now faced with trying to figure out what I could be allergic to? and what can I do to manage this so that I can finish my work? Is it possible that I am breathing in a vapor which is presenting as a reaction in my eyes or must it have direct contact with my eyes? Is it possible to figure out what is causing my reaction with the 100s of chemicals present in the lab?Some other notes which may help:-I am very careful in the lab, I always wear gloves, don't touch my eyes, and wash my hands with microshield before leaving-All hazardous chemicals which produce fumes are used in a fumehood-I was not using any different chemical on the day I got the reaction than what I had been using daily for the past month-I have been exposed to Ampicillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin, Geneticin and Kanamycin and have not had any problem and Chloramphenicol is available in our lab but nobody has been accessing it.Any information that could help me would be greatly appreciated!!	eye allergy|treatments|severe|soreness|symptoms|pain|sensitive to light|hands|eyes|Streptomycin|antibiotics|Ampicillin|Kanamycin|ointment

TRMT	Concerns about different hormones	Hi!    I had a total hystarectomy 4 months ago due to yrs of pain and other issues.    I'm 45 yrs old.    My doc immediately started me on progesterone to help kill off any residual traces of endometriosis that was present.    I was supposed to stay on this for 6 months before switching to estrogen.    At first, I turned into an ogre!    My family was walking on eggshells around me because no one wanted to set me off again.    As my body adjusted, I started becoming aware of the most wonderful things.    I was losing weight, my body shape was changing for the better, and I stopped eating sweets!    Don't want them.    They don't taste good to me anymore.    I was a diehard sweet addict before my surgery!    I had energy and felt like I had control of my life.Because my vaginal incision would not heal, he stopped the progesterone and started me on vivelle-dot .1 mg (almost nothing).    At first I just cried all the time about everything but it's getting better.    It's been 3 weeks on estrogen.    I'm trying to decide if I want to stay on this.    I'm having major brain fog, forgetfulness, lethargic, and my face is breaking out.    I have not had the 1st hot flash or any other typical symptom.    Honestly, I'm missing my progesterone!I'm wondering if my symptoms are caused by the estrogen.    Doc said I could stop it and see of the menopause symptoms got bad and then go back on it, but I'm afraid to make any more changes.    Just not sure about what I need to do.    I cannot tolerate this lack of energy and constant brain fog anymore.    Any suggestions?Lisa D	endometriosis|said|lethargic|hot flash|symptoms|symptom|pain|incision|vaginal|brain|body|face|back
SOCL	Cain announces he's suspending his campaign	http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45543805/ns/local_news-providence_ri/#.TtwGFFawWjIATLANTA, GA. --Republican candidate Herman Cain says he's suspending his bid for the Republican presidential nomination to avoid news coverage that is hurtful to his family.Cain's announcement came five days after an Atlanta-area woman claimed she and Cain had an affair for more than a decade, a claim that followed several allegations of sexual harassment against the Georgia businessman. Cain, whose wife stood behind him on the stage, made the announcement before several hundred supporters gathered at what was to have been the opening of his national campaign headquarters.Cain had surged in polls until news surfaced in late October that he had been accused of sexual harassment by two women during his time as president of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s.	polls

GOAL	Shall i Remove ICL?	Dear Doctor,I had a nearsight of -14 and -11 on left and right eye. I had undergone ICL surgery to my both eyes 2months back. But after surgery i had Floaters in my left eye. And sometimes i will have severe burings in both the eyes early in the mornings when i get up from bed. When i checked with the surgoens they said its nothing to do with ICL. But i am getting all this problems only after ICL surgery. So i have decide to remove ICL by next month. I want to know if is it safe to remove the ICL and go back to the Glasses? Will i have again any side effects on eyes like burinings or increse in the eye sight?Sorry to say this, but Life after ICL is very dis-appointing for me. I never thought ICL will be so risky for my life. Now i cant rub my eyes during night. If i do so i may get cataract on my both eyes. Everytime i needs to be careful with my Eyes now. But with glasses i was so free with many of my activities. But after ICL i cant do all the activities i was doing before. (Like Yoga, Playing, swimming, cant bend head down, which may cause to increase in intraocular pressure). Day and Night i am worried about my future, bcz of this i am not able to concentrate on my career. I was recently promoted as Team Leader. Each time I think of growing, i get the fear what will happen to my eyes.Please dont think that i am on the negitive side. Hope you understand my condition. I am person with so many regular activities in life. My day start with Gym, office, cooking, playing, watching movies and then back to bed. Now everything is gone for a toss after ICL. Everyday i need to be carefull. I never had dryness, burning in eyes till the ICL surgery. Each time i get new drops for dryness and buring. Which is irritating me. End of the day i feel tired in my eyes bcz of ICL.My Vision in Right eye is good, but after Black spots in left eye, my left eye vision is reduced.With ICL there is also a chances of Halos, Cataract and Glocoma. All these is putting me to bad expirence and fear and am not able to over come it.So I am just thinking that should i go back to Glasses and be safe from everything and start my old life back again. And I wish to be as normal as before.Please doctor, give me your kind suggestions what should I do?Regards,SantyThis discussion is related toShould I have ICL's removed?.	intraocular pressure|right eye|left eye|both eyes|eyes|Eyes|head|eye|feel tired|spots|discussion|Yoga|severe|condition|said|bend|nearsight|back

I'm not as hungry or i crave jut certain thing's out of the ordinary, mostly things i haven't eaten in a while. I've been really nauseous for the past few days and have been dealing with unexpected headaches, being incredibly thirsty all the time and heartburn when i wake up, I'm expecting my period in 5 day's, i know I'm not crazy feeling this way, it's just concerning me that i could possibly be pregnant. Im not trying to have a baby. I wouldn't mind if it happened, I'm just not trying to have one at this point in time. I've had a lot of sex this past month, mostly everyday sense the 6th of oct. on my period i had unprotected sex. I didn't think you could get pregnant on your period seeing as your uterus is cleaning it's self out. We had protected sex durning the end of my period and the started pulling out, i already know you can get pregnant that way, then we started using spermicide foam, i didn't read the label all the way through because we wanted to get moving along and we ha sex and then had sex 20 min after i didn't read the label stating you have to re apply every time you have sex... That was about a day or two before my ovulation because i looked at my period tracker. I have my period down to a T and it's tracked on it. Sorry for my long elaborate story, but is it possible you could feel this way before you find out your pregnant, and before your expected period?	headaches|heartburn|nauseous|hungry|uterus|ovulation|sense|lot|is cleaning
FAML	4 year old aggressiveness	My son just turned 4 at the end of August. He has been having behavioral issues at school and home. He will not listen most of the time. Time out does not phase him. We try the timer and also taking away things he enjoys. He is working on potty training but usually will not go unless we tell him to potty every 2 hours. He was doing really well at this till the past month. The daycare says he shoves others, hits, screams, and tears things off the walls. We really try to give him LOTS of postive attention as well especially when he is good or does something good. He acts as if he does not comprehend when we ask him to tell us when he has to potty or that it is not nice to hit, scream, etc... He gets so mad he clinches his fists and shakes all over and his face turns beet red. We have an appointment with a child psychologist at the end of October(first one we could get). I am afraid I am going to end up in the pscyh unit if something does not change soon.    Any help or suggestions are more than welcomed!!!	shakes|potty|face

She is very concerned with taking small bites and chewing it until it's a liquid before she swallow's. She also has the ""gift of gab"" and uses it just about everynight at supper time. My husband and I are not slow eaters, nor is our 3 year old son. We noticed that while we are eating, she spends most of the time talking about random stuff, and then when we are done she wants to be done. however, she's only ate about 1/8th of her food. We have tried different things like re-assureing her that larger bites are ok and that she will not choke as long as she chews it good. We have stopped all conversation at supper so she can focus on eating. We have set a timer so she is encouraged to eat faster to beat the timer. But nothing is working. We don't want to make her the outcast by removing her from the table to eat by herself, but our family is very close and Dinner time is when we talk about our day and the kids day, so not talking at the supper table is killing us. Another thing we noticed is that as soon as everyone else is done, she will have a million and one excuses to get up from the table. (although we won't allow her up until her supper is gone). I have decreased the amount of food I give her, so she seemingly finishes quicker, to give her a sense of accomplishment. but now we're bordering on unhealthyness. She has lost 4lbs in the last month and her school reports the same poor eating habits as home. What can we do to get her to eat her food and in a reasonable amount of time?? I don't want her to be unhealthy, but we can't allow her to take 2 hours to eat a slice of pizza either. Any suggestions???? Anyone????another tid bit of info is All meals are the same way, and she never was a bad eater as a baby it's been since pretty much she could talk =]"	liquid|choke|sense

I only get them once and a while. But that's once too often for me.They put an end to the whole day and I really dont like to spend my day with my head in the toilet.Does any one have any home remedy suggestions (other than tylenol etc or ice pack) to put a stop to these.I was tried on prescription Imetrex years ago, but cannot take it, due to heart issues.Also I'd like something I can take if I am fortunate enough to get pregnant.ThanksZiggy	migraine headaches|home remedy|ice|catch|heart|head|right
SOCL	Advice..	"Okay I have read some of the post and replies on here and it kinda scares me to put a post on here. Okay here goes...I married in November of 2001, since then the marriage has been in and out, what I mean is we were together then we seperate then get back together. We now have been back together for a year and things are not going well at all! I thought he changed now, the man is almost 62! But even on disabilty he works 7 days a week. I rarely see him at home anymore. And he is picking up drinking once again and when he drinks he gets rude and a bully. I have put in my application for divorce and for a goverment apartment, but with goverment helped there is 3 stimpulations (for the divorce). 1. all properties are to be sold and divided evenly (we dont have any property), 2. was something else, and 3. was agreed custody over our duaghter. I sat down and tried talking to him calmly, but I don't see him agreeing on it. I take care of my daughter pretty much on my own (school issues, doctors,. etc), so the only thing I want is to have her during school time and he can have her all the rest, but as I said he just mumbled and walked off saying, ""ok I guess I'm the babysitter for the Summer!"" That's not at all what I meant, there will be camping trips that we will go on and I will take her with me, so it's not like he's stuck with her. I mean he agreed long time ago to put his name on her birth certificate I never forced him. And no biologically he is not her father, nor will she ever know. I was strung out on meds during our seperation and had a one night stand, enough said. I did not say anything, but one day he said let's go change her birth certificate, I said are you sure? And he said yes definetly. So I give him credit for that.But as time goes on I begin to get lonely. I mean in the last year I live with my stuff in a storage unit, never seeing or using it. I don't know why, but when we moved back into together my stuff was stored and he insisted that we use his stuff only. Hell we don't even sleep in the same bed, I have been on the couch almost the whole time. What kind of married life is that?And this women he works for calls him all hours of the day and night and he jumps up and goes, but when I call his cell he won't answer it. It's just strange to me that when I invite him out to a lunch he says he's busy, but when this woman calls I found out he has gone out with her. It's also strange that when I go to my parents on the weekend I am accused of things. I have only slipped up once in our marriage and I was totally wasted, which is not an excuse I know, but it did happen and he knew and forgave me and we moved on.But my problem is the lonliness.So lately I have been meeting new friends, guys and girls and have been going out when I can. Due to my illness that is very rare. So maybe I have gone out twice in the last year.But it just seems like we're more roommates than anything. We have seperate bank accounts, I never know how much he earns, heck I don't even know truthfully if we're renting or buying or what on this trailer we live in. He took away the car I was transporting the kids in, he said it wasn't in his name and couldn't afford the isurance. Well our insurance for 3 vechiles is only about $50 a month! So then he hide all the title and registrations to the vechiles, but he didn't realize the one truck is legally in my name, so at least now I have this piece of crap truck.But I know my main concern is my kids. So far my son is admittly going with me (I had in a previous relationship wayyy before my marriage) and my daughter wants to stay with her father, but that concerns me greatly. She is on medication for bi-polar, ADHD, ODD, OCD, elipesy and a mood disorder. I am afraid he will not take care of her needs and I have seen this when I am gone on the weekends, but she admittly says she don't want to live with me.As I work on my divorce and getting my own place I am also working on myself. I am agorophobic, ADD, have anxiety attacks and nerve twitches. So I am trying to get better, but it is a hard and long wrong.So in the meantime should I stay at home? I mean to me it feels like the marriage is already over, long time over. My parents say that I am legally married and should remain at home. Then how come he gets to run everywhere without worrying about me? How come he goes outside to answer a phone call or go to another room?I know there is 2 sides to every story and this is mine. So as I said any advice??"	application|disorder|wasted|said|illness|nerve|back

GOAL	metformin	"Hi, I am type 2 diabetic and have been slowly losing weight with therapy help with an ""Eating Disorder Clinic"" therapist, run by my local health authority. By learning to eat properly and a PROPER balanced diet I am SLOOOWLY losing weight (my therapist is a cognitive). BUT I started at 22 and a half stone. I am now 20 stone and it has taken me 18 months of SENSIBLE    eating to do this (NO MORE DIETING FOR ME!!!!!). Today, after a battle of 3 years (to lose weight without rediculous dieting fads which help you lose, and then 2 years later put your weight lose BACK ON X2!!!) I finally got to see a bariatric surgeon at my request. Unfortunately because of the demand for banding (since FERN of GOOD MORNING TV on ITV - UK) our PCT has withdrawn funding for bariatric surgery, and have stipulated a very hard path to apply individually for funded surgery. And believe me they have made it very hard. SO I went to my precious appointment filled with fright and a deep fear/dread. I suffer panic attacks too and they are really bad, and sometimes (actually most times) get in the way of my communications. My surgeon was so surportive, I just wept, I expected a battle. He has immediately prescribed me METFORMIN telling me because I am a type 2 diabetic AND I am taking Orlistat (Xenical) and real YAK weight loss drug I can tell you, but it does work! Well he has reassured me that with a balanced diet, and having taken Orlistat for the last 3 months, that I continue with it and add Metformin and it will make me lose weight, that will do for me, This is the guy who if I do end up having banding will be doing it and I trust him to bits. Any one got any support    :o) or advice for this desperate to lose female? I am in a wheelchair wrong side of 50, and very reclusive. Would love to speak to someo0ne in the same situation as me as it gets lonely at times. luv and hugs to those of you who can relate to me.

DISE	Balance Problem/Twitching/Brain Fog/Fatigue	"I had a painful headache 4 years ago for a month or so.Since then I had CONSTANT feeling of ""unbalancedness"" feeling like swaying and falling(not room spinning)and extreme fatigue.Other symptoms include cant concentrate,poor memory and finding hard to speak properly at times which I believed is called brain fog.The most weird part of the symptoms is that I experience twitching/throbbing/spasm/tingling feeling all over my body although they are painless.No fainting,no blur vision and no vomitting.Now there is no specific area where there is pain and somehow i dont feel ""sick"".I feel extremely tired,unbalanced and cant concentrate.I dont feel depressed or anxious and if I am or did it is as a result of having those symptoms and not the other way around.Im sick of people and doctors telling me its ""all in the head"",reduce your stress level bla bla.....Went to a neurologist a few months after that headache and after many blood test,and an MRI done,EMG(i think) he diagnosed it as migraine.Im not really sure what they were checking for in the blood tests and the neurologist didnt really explain to me anything.That was around 2 1/2 years ago and I wasnt really doing any research on my condition and symptoms because I thought the doctors would know it all.And ofcourse I was wrong.However the feeling of dizzy and feeling like falling over stil persist 24/7.Its somehow i feel there is no activity in my brain and find it hard to concentrate when Im reading or listening to someone.I also find that my legs and hands are weak most of the time and cant really exert myself.When im walking down the stairs i feel like falling over forwards and even when i take the lift and step out of it i feel really dizzy.Same with after going out of a moving vehicle.Legs feel like jelly now and hands feel a bit numb.Another symptom is apathy if u could count that as a symptom.My neurologist doesnt seem to be helpful and in fact he discharged me and I would require a referral letter to see him again.Should i go to the ENT specialist?Im quite sick of going to doctors and cant get a proper diagnosis.But my hearing seems fine and i dont experience tinnitus as far as I know.Or could it be as ""simple"" as B12 defiency?Or is it some kind of virus?I dont think I have lyme as where Im from its rare to find ticks around.Lately its becoming worse and something as simple as walking is difficult for me.Should I go to an ENT or have my vitamin/mineral levels checked?"	extreme fatigue|Other symptoms|symptoms|fainting|painful|finding|symptom|spasm|tired|dizzy|pain|weak|headache 4|room spinning)and|diagnosed|hearing|condition|tingling|brain|hands|body|legs|Legs|ENT

FAML	My 4 year old daughter is having trouble interacting with other Children	I need advice! I have a four year old daughter who is having difficulty interacting with other children including her younger brother. She is very very smart. She does very well in school. When we go to the park and she goes to interact with other children, she will start be immediately saying that she has or can do something better than them. For example she saw some children playing tag and she went up and continuously told them she can run faster and jump higher. The kids got sick of hearing how she can do things better and eventually just said Ã¢ € œI donÃ¢ € ™t careÃ¢ €  and walked away and did not allow her to play with them anymore. This has happened many times.    I have tried to help her by simply telling her just to ask the other children if she can play and explain the best way I could to a 4 year old how that can sometimes hurt other kidÃ¢ € ™s feelings or make them feel like you implying your better and they are not good at what they are doing.    She is this way at home as well.    If someone is playing with a toy (her little brother or any little child for that fact) and an adult says anything positive to that child she will immediately go and take the toy and say Ã¢ € œ look at meÃ¢ €  so that the focus is not on that child but on her. Then she will just put the toy on the ground and no longer be interested as long as the other kid is not or the adult is no longer paying attention to it.    It has become more and more of a problem. When ever we are in any social situation a park, relatives etc, she cannot stop saying all the things she can do that is better than any child in the room or area. She ends up fighting with the kids because she will take things from them just because someone (some adult) paid attention to it and the child playing with it. We give her so much attention at home but it seems to not be enough. She will push her brother or even her little cousins right off of our laps so she can sit their just because they were sitting there. Then when the other child is not interested in being in our laps she hops right off. She does this behavior not just around us but any adult family member or family friend or teacher.    I am feeling like she does this in need of attention but in the process it upsets other children.    Her younger brother is 2 and he adores her and naturally wants to copy everything his bigger sister does so he is now learning this behavior. Has anyone ever had this problem? If so what can be causing this behavior and what can I do to fix it? Like I said before she certainly does not have lack of attention at home, I think? So what else can be going on?    Her father thinks it just her personality to be competitive.	hearing|said|right

FAML	Normal 8 year old?	"My children are with me Friday-Sunday and during the week with their mother and step-father.    I understand that during the week there are many time constraints on all of them; getting ready for school, breakfast, pick-up from daycare/school, doing homework, bath, etc.    As for the weekends it's happy-go-lucky fun with dad, but I always enforce any restrictions that were developed during the week.In the pass six months or so we've noticed a change in behavior with our son.    He doesn't want to do things like go the movies, parks, pool, or even to Seaworld.    He has to constantly be told to do his homework although his overall grades in school are quite good.    He refuses to each meals that he used to enjoy eating based on ""God knows why!""    He thinks that his mom is bullying him, but I know she isn't because that's not the kind of person that she is.    When he and I discuss the reasons why we do the things we do for him he tells me that he understands.    His mom thinks that he's depressed and I just think that he is just going through a phase until he starts realizing that going out and playing with friends may change his negative attitude.    Taking away tv, toys, and video games is one thing, but to deny him to play with his friends because of his behavior may have realize that he needs to abide by the rules.""Is this all normal?"""	bath|overall

TRMT	Is Adhesions Disease made wrose by Mastocytsis?	I'm a 40 year old female who since the age of 23 has had abdominal pain. In 1996 @ the age of 26 I was given a hysterectomy for what was thought to be Endometriosis. I was misdiagnosed and did not have endometriosis. Having this surgery only caused things to get much worse, in 1999 (age 29) I had to under go another surgery to remove the one ovary that was left due to pain & because it looked abnormal on my ultrasound.When they opened me up my intestions were cut because they were in the wrong place & appox 7 inches had to be removed. It took 3 top surgeons almost 6 hours to remove all of the adhesions. Since that time my Gallbladder has had to be removed & the abdominal pain is still very bad.In 2003 I suddenly went into Anaphylactic shock and began getting more troublesome and annoying symptoms. Hives, chronic pelvic and bone pain, hypersensitivity to heat, nausea, faintness, diarrhea, low blood pressure & itchy skin if bumped or rubbed .I was told that I have Mastocytsis @ that time. I have to carry an EpiPen at all times now.My question is this...since Mastocytsis affects the connective tissue & adhesions are scar tissue can one disorder make the other worse? If so are there ANY treatments ...or studies for these disorders?My quality of life of hasn't been good since 1996 so ANY information would be GREATLY helpful.Thank You Very Much for your time in this matter.Hopeful In MO	Anaphylactic shock|endometriosis|disorder|Hives|heat|be Endometriosis|disorders?My|Gallbladder|pelvic|ovary|bone|cut|ultrasound|treatments|faintness|symptoms|nausea|pain|abdominal|misdiagnosed
FAML	Six year old who is panicking about school	"My son is six years old.    He went to an all day pre-kindergarten class last year and is in all day kindergarten this year.    He had some trouble adjusting to his pre-k class as this was his first time away from me all day with anyone outside the family.    But, finally he adjusted and seemed to like school.    He would say at times that he didn't want to go to school, but we would make him and he would be fine once he got there.He has been sick frequently with asthma, etc. and I believe this has made him think that if he says he is sick he will not have to go to school.This year during kindergarten, he did very well the first semester.    Then after Christmas break, he has been giving me different reasons why he doesn't want to go to school.    First it was that his stomach was hurting, then he said he was being picked on by other kids.    I talked to the teacher about this and I believe the issue has been resolved.    This has been verified by my son who said that the kids are not picking on him any longer.    Now, he is stating that there is something ""creepy"" about his school.    Another word he uses is that it is ""scary.""    He is literally worried about going to school at all points of every day (when he is not there).    This weekend he has a long weekend and he is already asking me if he has to go to school on Tuesday.I began thinking this was simply a ""put-on"" but as time passes I would think he would stop making excuses and just go to school.Can children who are only six years old have anxiety, depression, panic problems?

At school they did an assesment test and he refused to do it, he curled up into a little ball and shy'ed away.    His teacher told me today.    He has been to occupational therapy which has helped a lot, except with the emotional side.    He refuses to answer when asked a question.    He has friends at school and they play nicely together.    He also has a 4 year old brother who he fights with alot, or will tease him by taking a toy away.    Or he is demanding and will tell his brother that he can't do this or that or eat this or that, etc, etc.    His brother is outgoing, friendly and very active.    I feel like i am getting angrier by the day.    I am feeling like a bad mom and keep asking myself where did i go wrong ending my thoughts in tears.    I have taken away his computer games in hopes it will help a bit until I can see some improvement.    I was adviced to take him to play therapy, but it is so expensive at the moment we can't afford it unless we take the 4 year old out of school for a few months.    His father and I have spoken to him and asked why he does not answer when the teacher asks him a question and he said that his heart beats fast and everything just flies all over and he forgets the answer even though he knows the answer.    He gets like this in groups.    He is fine one on one.    If someone has any suggestions on what I can do to help him open up more please any advice would help..

DEMO	Too Dry, Too Wet	I have a problem that happens during intercourse. During sex, my husband and I start out just fine. He plays a little at first and then I get wet enough for him to penetrate. After a little bit and few different positions, I start to dry out around the outside of my vagina. (Wet on the inside and dry on the outside) This makes it hard for him to penetrate me. So I    put a little bit of lube on myself and then he is able to penetrate....The problem is that It's tooooo wet then, and I can't dry out! Then we just kinda give up. Please help me to figure out the problem! Also, I have problems orgasming. My husband can but I can't! I really want to and I've tried many things like to not think about (wanting) to, and thinking different thoughts and everything. Please help me to figure out a different way to orgasm with my husband. Thank you	vagina
SOCL	Blood blister	I have a tiny blood blister on the under side of my penis.

How can I permanently get rid of this????	penis|back
TRMT	Colon Cleanse	I have done a number of things over the past several months to improve my health.    After being diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis several months ago I was finally able to adjust my diet (no refined sugar, no refined carbohydrates) and begin a good exercise program once my thyroid medication was adjusted appropriately.    I also take a number of supplements (probiotics, vitamin D, B-12, digestive enzymes, CLA, etc.).Anyway, I've been interested in doing a colon cleanse and am trying to find the best product.    I have read quite a bit about Colonix, which seems to be very good, but I'm always skeptical of online reviews, and thought there might be some people on these boards who have tried it or another product.    If you've done a colon cleanse, please share your experience, the product, results, etc.    As much information as you are willing to share would be helpful.    Also, I'm interested in knowing if you lost any weight as a result of the cleanse.Thanks in advance for your feedback!	Hashimoto's thyroiditis|diagnosed|colon

Just stopping by wondering if anyone has a found their secret to getting there weight down yet?I have been doing a very simple thing that has lowered my weight by 8 pounds. Counting calories. I wanted to go one a diet similiar to the one my doctor may be giving me with adding an additional treatment plan. I am not very found of what he is suggesting - so I thought I would see if the diet I would need to do with it - may give me the results I am looking for.Basically I am trying to eat at least four times a day and maintaining only at most 1100 calories. OMG is this a challenge.    I literally am counting every single thing and then deciding if I could gain more food elsewhere by making a better choice. I drink a glass of water before each meal. I eat very small portions of food.I have not been hungry - yet I am making such limited choices.Not sure if this is the right plan - but I do feel better watching what I am taking in.So my poll below is about all of you. I love these things and hope it is OK I post one here. The poll is basically about how you are doing on your weight loss.	weight|hungry|watching|poll|right
SOCL	Hypcalciemia	I recently found out that when I was 9 days old I was admitted to the NICU with seizures. After testing I had very low calcium levels that caused the seizures. I was given calcium supplements whicdh seemed to correct the problem except that my baby teet/molars came in with no enamel on them. I also became pigeon toed and seemed to fracture bones from sporty accidents under the age of 10.Is there a possible genetic link here that caused the low calcium in the first place?	pigeon toed|seizures|molars|bones|baby teet|correct

TRMT	Worried about underweight toddler	"I am not sure what to do about my 18 mos. old son.    I have been advised by my doctor that he is underweight, and off his growth curve.    At last measure (we go again in two days) he was 32"" and 22lbs.    He has been sick with colds on and off, and teething on top of it all, so his food intake is now at an all time low.    One day he will be so excited about the foods we give him, then then next day, he won't touch anything at all.    Since he has a cold again right now, he's eating VERY little.    My doctor had advised me to hide butter and olive oil in his foods to try to get him to fatten up a bit.    But how do I get those into him if he doesn't eat anything!    It's the same thing with trying to get a multivitamin down him...he hates the flavour of the drops, but since he isn't eating anything, I can't hide it in food either!    I broke down and bought him the toddler formula diet supplement, but he can't handle the flavour...it actually makes him shudder!    I'm trying everything, but I'm always afraid to go back to the doctor, as I know she's going to be on my case again!    We've already had him to a paediatrician who, at the time, said she saw nothing wrong with my son.    What to do now?    Please help!"	formula diet|colds|said|olive|back|right
SOCL	Finger Swelling and Turned Blue / Then Red	OK, bit worried about this one...I'm a 31 year old male in generally good health.I was sitting today when my pointer finger began to feel like it was pulsating. I looked at it at the inside of the middle joint was a bit swollen and I could see the skin had turned a blue color, about the size of a dime. Finger felt kind of uncomfortable, especially when flexing it, but it was not painful.Over the next six hours or so, the swelling did not really increase, but the blue-ishness did. Maybe the size of a dime or two. It is blue on the palm side of my finger and a bit on the side. Now some seven to eight hours later it appears more like a bruise and on the side of my finger it is a deep red color.Any ideas what is going on?Thanks	painful|finger|Finger|color|palm
GOAL	ACIDOPHILUS	"This is directed at Rodium:Sorry if I misspelled your name, I just stumbled across this article while writing a persuasive speech on why gum is good for you.    I just want to point out that Acidophilus would probably make your problem worse because it doesn't actually kill bacteria.    That particular culture of bacteria is one that resides in your stomach and aids in regulating the digestion process.    Usually you would take something like that if you've been really sick lately or have problems digesting food, maybe some nausea issues.    I do know that there is a product called ""Zytex"" that's supposed to help counteract such extreme bad breath, but what it really comes down to is that you need to make sure you clean your teeth properly and have them cleaned regularly.

Heard this on the radio on my way into work this morning (950AM, Houston, TX), so I thought I'd share.(It's a Conservative talk-show... just thought I'd mention that)The question was posed to Democrats, and is simple:If Barack Obama was a Republican, would you think that Republicans were mistaken to want him voted into office for a 2nd-term?(All things being equal and him sitting in the White House with his current list of successes and failures. The economy exactly as it stands. Unemployment exactly as it stands. Healthcare exactly as it stands. Him having made good on some promises, and not-so-much on other promises.

TRMT	My hair's falling out and it's scaring me, why is this happening?	I'm a teenage female and for the last few months I've noticed more and more of my hair is falling out. At first I thought I was just shedding, or tying my hair back caused it to look like more was falling out. These days after a shower the drain is really clogged with hair and everytime I run my hands through my hair at least 4 to 6 hairs come out. It doesn't seem drastic, and it's not visible yet, but it's just a LOT of hair to come out in one day. My diet isn't very varied, but I take Centrum. What's causing this sudden hair loss?

DISE	Head/Neck Pain	Basically, just over a month ago I suffered from continuous bouts of strong headaches. For about 10 days, I had a constant headache that faded slightly with paracetamol. I went to see the doctor about this and he diagnosed stress/tension headaches. However, although I have not had a 'headache' since then, I have had a pain in my ear, pain in the back of my head and pain in my lower neck. I also have a cyst on the top of my head which has grown larger recently, though my doctor said it is unrelated to the problems recently (as it is still small). As I have had these problems for a reasonably long time without any real improvement, does anyone have any ideas?	constant headache|pain in back|headaches|pain|tension headaches|cyst|said|diagnosed|head|ear

SOCL	NRA Rewrites History To Hide Romney Support For Assault Weapons Ban	"NRA News is deliberately misleading its supporters about Mitt Romney's firearms policies while he served as governor of Massachusetts. During the October 2 edition of Cam & Company, host Cam Edwards suggested that any action taken by then-Governor Romney on assault weapons was supported by Massachusetts state gun rights group Gun Owners Action League (GOAL) and further stated that Romney ""actually undid some of the damage"" of the commonwealth's 1998 assault weapons ban. In fact, legislation signed by Romney in 2004 made the Massachusetts assault weapons ban permanent.A July 1, 2004 press release issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, titled, ""Romney Signs Off On Permanent Assault Weapons Ban,"" leaves little doubt that the former Massachusetts governor was involved in restricting access to assault weapons. Indeed, at the bill's signing ceremony Romney stated that the ""sole purpose"" of assault weapons is ""hunting down and killing people."" In response to the new law, GOAL stated that the Romney administration ""took a major shot at lawful gun owners and showed their true colors.""CAM EDWARDS, HOST: Doc in Jacksonville, Florida says, ""Cam, due to the fact that Mitt Romney signed a gun ban into law while he was governor of Massachusetts, does the NRA trust him to stand up for the Constitution and Second Amendment as president?"" You know, I'm glad you asked this question, Doc. Last time -- I've got to promote this video because we've got it up I know on our YouTube page -- the last time we had Jim Wallace from the Gun Owners Action League in studio, that's the state-level organization in Massachusetts, we asked him about this. Because Mitt Romney did sign a bill as Governor of Massachusetts, but he did not institute an assault weapons ban. This was actually a bill that the Gun Owners Action League in Massachusetts supported. The quote unquote assault weapons bill, or excuse me the quote unquote assault weapons ban, was already law in Massachusetts. It was already permanent in Massachusetts. This bill actually provided some relief to gun owners in the state of Massachusetts. It was portrayed and it has been portrayed in the media as Governor Romney signed a bill to ban quote unquote assault weapons in the state of Massachusetts. But that's not the case. This was a bill, as I said, that was supported by the state gun owners' organization in Massachusetts because it actually undid some of the damage of that original legislation.From the press release announcing the signing into law of ""An Act Furthering Regulating Certain Weapons"" by Governor Romney:""Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts,"" Romney said, at a bill signing ceremony with legislators, sportsmen's groups and gun safety advocates.    ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense.    They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.""[...]""We are pleased to mark an important victory in the fight against crime,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.    ""The most important job of state government is ensuring public safety.    Governor Romney and I are determined to do whatever it takes to stop the flood of dangerous weapons into our cities and towns and to make Massachusetts safer for law-abiding citizens.""While GOAL did support reforms to Massachusetts' gun licensing scheme contained in the legislation, the group was outraged by Romney's position on assault weapons.In a July 2, 2004 GOAL press release titled, ""Firearm Reform Bill Signed, Romney Takes Opportunity to Betray Gun Owners,"" the organization expressed dismay that Romney took a position on assault weapons that echoed that of gun violence prevention stalwarts Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.On July 1, 2004 , Governor Mitt Romney signed into law one of the greatest of reforms to Massachusetts gun laws in recent history. In what should have been a day of celebration for GOAL and its members, the Romney administration took a major shot at lawful gun owners and showed their true colors.[...]Governor Romney then took the podium to make a few remarks before signing the bill. Although the Governor did make mention of being a ""sportsman"" and the reforms in the bill that would help other sportsmen, he spun the bill as a ban.""Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts ,"" Romney said. ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense.    They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.""When asked by a reporter if he supported the renewal of the federal ""assault weapons"" ban and if he had spoken to the senators about it, Governor Romney replied that it was not really his job to lobby on federal legislation, but that he shared Senator Kerry's and Senator Kennedy's position on the issue!Edward's claim that a permanent assault weapon ban already existed in Massachusetts in 2004 -- a talking point that appeared in GOAL's 2004 press release -- is also false. In reality, the legislation updated Massachusetts' assault weapon ban, which mirrored the federal assault weapons ban, to ensure that state law continued to ban assault weapons even after the federal ban expired at the end of 2004.As Romney's press release explains:Like the federal assault weapons ban, the state ban, put in place in 1998, was scheduled to expire in September.    The new law ensures these deadly weapons, including AK-47s, UZIs and Mac-10 rifles, are permanently prohibited in Massachusetts no matter what happens on the federal level.This is not the first time the National Rifle Association has tried to whitewash Romney's history on assault weapons. In a September 6 interview, NRA's chief lobbyist Chris Cox asked Romney, ""As governor, you signed a major bill reforming Massachusetts' gun registration and licensing laws. Some in the media and elsewhere claim this bill was a reauthorization of the semi-auto ban in Massachusetts. What's your response?"" Romney replied that the legislation in question ""expanded the rights of Massachusetts gun owners"" and said he opposed laws ""intended to burden gun owners and sportsmen.""The NRA, whose media arm NRA News may as well be a ""Romney for President"" advertisement on loop, is waging an ""All In"" campaign that seeks to remove President Obama from office. It is just hard to see, however, how backing the enactor of ""An Act Furthering Regulating Certain Weapons"" plays into the narrative that Obama, who has taken no action to restrict firearm ownership during his first term, is the real gun grabber.http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/03/nra-rewrites-history-to-hide-romney-support-for/190318"	administration|destruction|prevention|recreation|Edwards|said|semi|sole|Bill|arm|Cam|rights|colors

SOCL	I'm losing hair rapidly	In March of this year I was hospitalized for 9 day with the flu and pneumonia. While I was in the hospital my hair came out in clumps a few times, but in the last few weeks IÃ¢ € ™ve noticed large amount of loss and breakage. My doctor thinks itÃ¢ € ™s from the shock of being in the ICU and thereÃ¢ € ™s nothing to worry about. She did order a blood test to check my thyroid. IÃ¢ € ™m now entering my third month of being out of the hospital, should I still be seeing hair loss and breakage? If so, when do things return to normal? Could I go completely bald? If I do will it grow back? Is there any other explanation, like am I experiencing female pattern baldness or alopecia?Also, I believe I was on prednisone while I was in the hospital and I came home with it. I was on it for 14 days. Could the prednisone be causing this and how long does it stay in the system.IÃ¢ € ™ve always had a lot of hair and now the volume is considerably less, and my hairline is receding around the temples. My hair no longer has that healthy look to it. My hair changes from week to week. IÃ¢ € ™m so upset over this.	female pattern baldness|bald|flu|pneumonia|temples|back|order|hairline|hair|lot

His sex drive is high and he wants to have sex all the time but can never seem to climax.    He makes sure that I always climax but then once I am done he stops and says that he doesn't think he is going to be able to climax today.    I have talked to him about this several times.    He says its not me and that I satisfy him very much.    I know he is not turned off by me or anything I am very physically attractive and in shape he is always telling me how beautiful and sexy I am.    I am very experimental and open with sex we try new things all the time and I give him oral sex all the time too.    He says that he thinks he doesn't climax during sex because he masterbates so much (3 times a day sometimes!)    We don't live together yet so im not able to give him sex 3 times a day like he probably wants lol.    I read several articles about this and many of them suggested that men who can't climax have a psychological fear of pregnancy.    He says he doesn't (and he knows that I am on birth control).    I also should mention that over the past few months he has gained like 30 lbs and it seems like once he put on this wait he lost some of his sexual ""stamina"".    We talked about this and he has started working out and eating healthier...but he smokes alot also.    Has anyone else experienced this problem or have any advice or suggestions for me about what they problem might be??? Thanks guys!!"	pregnancy

FAML	7 year old son still poops in his pants daily	Hi, I have been having problems with my 7 year old son he would rather go poop in his pants then on the pot and it is very stressful on the both of us he is starting second grade this year at a new school and i am really scared that kids will make fun of him for it and his family will hardly even come around us because he goes at least 5 times a day and that is not normal for a 7 year old to go that much. I have taken him to the doctor and all they tell me is to bribe him with toys or to take things away that he likes to play with but nothing has worked and i have tried everything. I do not know what else to do and need a professional or a psychiatrist to help me out. I almost need someone else to see if they can train him because he just wont do it for me i am running out of options if someone could please help us.

DISE	Help	Recently I have been experiencing gallbladder like problems.    Pain in breastbone area, right side of abdomen below rib cage, and pain in the back.    I went to the ER today and they performed a ultrasound, blood test and CAT scan.    All came back negative for any problems with my gall bladder or liver.    They did however see that several of my lymph nodes in my abdomen were enlarged.    Anyone ever see anything like this.    All the symptoms I am having are consistant with gall stones or gall bladder problems, but I have no damage to gall bladder or gallstones.    This is getting really really frustrating.    I also recently had blood work for HIV and hepatitis and both came back negative.	pain in back|symptoms|gall bladder|breastbone|rib cage|liver|nodes|ultrasound|enlarged|abdomen|back|gallstones|hepatitis|right

GOAL	Help losing weight	I am a 25 yr old male 5ft 10in and I weight 200lbs. I'm trying to lose 15-20 lbs but I've been stuck at 200lbs for the past 2 years. I work out 4-5 times a week and I intake around 1700 calories...no more than 1800 a day. My exercise involves running 2-3 miles and then doing some strength training (benchpress, curls, lateral raises....etc I get at least 1 to 2 days of leg workouts in within the week) My food is healthy, the only thing I think I am missing is protein but I'm not sure if not having enough protein is contributing to me not losing weight. I hear people talk about how they lose a pound a week and the such, but I've run 5 miles a day for 5 days straight for 1 month and have only lost 1-2 lbs. What am I doing wrong?!Thank you	strength training|weight|leg|1-2|protein

DISE	Depression hurts, I dont know what can help!	I am 18 years old. I was in a car accident in Febuary that injuried my mom. Along with the guilt I do feel, I am reminded that I almost killed her. Often. I didnt drive for 9 months and then I moved in with my dad and drove for one month. When I first started driving I was just afraid of the express way and I would have anxiety attacks while driving. Over the weeks however new, random, things started giving me anxiety attacks. For example running a yellow light, or someone too close to my side of the rode. Stuff that I didnt use to get afraid of. They then turned into panic attacks. The last time I drove I had a panic attack with my little brother in the car because I ran a yellow light. I cant drive.. It is the worst thing ever. I cant get into another wreck. I had to move back in with my grandma because I couldnt drive. Which has caused alot of family drama because my father hates her. Ontop of this ongoing problem I have had some major problems with depression. I cannot get out of bed most days and I sleep all my days away. The only place I can go and be a little bit happy is work. I love working and talking to people, when im alone I just get so depressed when Im alone. Nothing helps my depression anymore. I used to cut myself or hurt myself physically. But after I went to the hospital for cutting myself that doesnt even work anymore. I just feel so depressed it hurts all the time. I get headaches in the back of my head and I just feel so empty. My mom thinks I am just dumb. I made an appointment with my doctor to talk to him about my depression that has now lasted for 4 years and she thought it was the worst idea ever. She said he would just think I want attention or drugs or something. I dont, I just want to feel better. This is killing me. I dont know what to do.	reminded|cutting|back|head|cut|said|light

TRMT	Uncontrolable output	My 7 monthbild nephew has an ileostomy. They think he might have pseudo obstruction because he gets distended and has bilious vomit ( only when he is distended ). The doctors say he gets distended from bacterial overgrowth. I read somewhere that ikeostomies can contribute to bacterial overgrowth. Has anyone experienced this. It seems the bag has caused more problems than help him. He also has high output amounts and it's mostly liquid. They consider it diarreah(diarrhea). They say it can be from the ostomy or from the bacterial overgrowth. Either way, they have tried several meds and nothing seems to work. Now they are talking about a small bowel transplant!!    Shouldn't they try reversing the ostomy first to see what happens?    Has anyone had problems like these?    Please, any information at all will be helpful to us.

He does it almost all day now.    When I draw attention to it, he says ""It's making me want to do it."" and become sometimes very upset.    It is interfering with handwriting, eating, drinking, etc. because of the position of his fingers... not to mention just the strangeness of how it looks!He has always had ""control"" issues and other strange behaviors, such as late to use the toilet especially for bowel movements, refuses to wear lace-up shoes because it bothers him (to put it nicely) if the laces touch the ground or flop around, hates long sleeve shirts under a coat because the sleeves ride up... the list goes on.    We have always been able to cope with the behaviors in the past because there was an alternate solution (bathroom problem = Miralax, shoelaces = Velcro, long sleeves = short sleeves), but since he is the only one who can change/modify this one, I don't know what to do.Should I be worried?

TRMT	morphea and a coup de sabre	I have a scar which is on the top left side of my nose (near the eye). It is light brown, and visible because my nose looks dented due to the lack of tissue in that area.    When I was 15 I saw a dermatologist and she said I had a mild case of Morphea scleroderma and a coup de sabre, because of the physicality of the scar and the tissue. She said I was lucky because in some cases it is worse, because the process of the tissue decreasing has stopped. Since the area which the scar is located is lacking tissue, makes my nose look crooked.    I want to know if I can look into taking some corrective surgery to fix my problem.

DISE	werid headaches?	Sorry this might not make sense but its pretty confusing and ill do my best to explain. Alright so, roughly a month ago I was daydreaming in class when i started thinking about the dream i had the night before. I generally can't remember an entire dream and this time wasn't an exception. I can't remember exactly what part of the dream I was remembering only that it was pretty fuzzing and i couldn't remember the smaller details. Anyway all of a sudden, my heart started pumping like i was running or something, my head hurt and it felt like someone stabbed me in the stomach. It went away after a minute or two but left me of a headache the rest of the day. This has happened to me around 2-5 times a week now without fail. Some things tend to trigger it. I take french as a second language and randomly in class a phrase or word will remind me of memory or something deep in my mind and when i try to think of what it is i'm remembering    i get the heart, head, & stomach ache. It's so fast i can't help it or stop it what-so-ever. No matter where i am it can happen. At first i thought i just had something nagging at me but now im getting worried as its not going away. They aches aren't progressivly getting worse but some are bad enough to make me quit whatever i'm doing and stop for a moment. I a little worried that it may be a tumor. I know this sounds reaallly strange and I promise im not making this up. I also don't have any previous medical problems other than severe scoliosis.

FAML	12 year old boy exibiting behavioral problems	My stepson lives with his mother who goes to work early in the morning before the bus.    He is routinely skipping school, has been suspended for bullying, is not doing his homework or obeying the teacher at school.    At home he has been stealing money from his mothers purse and stealing his sister and mothers bras and underwear.    When his father and I have him and try to talk to him he will start crying, wailing, and crawl under the bed or desk.    I am very concerned that we are in for some big trouble unless we get this situation under control and can communicate by our actions and disciplinary actions that this behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

DISE	Not sure where or what to do?	"I am a 35 yr old female in good health EXCEPT for daily, chronic, headaches. In 2003 a hemangenomia was found in my left skull. It was surgically removed and left a rather large scar on my scalp. A part of bone was removed and replaced with metal mesh.    Since then, I have had daily headaches. At first it was connected to the surgery, but after time, the doctors said it may have been nerve damage or just a coincidence.I have seen several specialists. Went through many types of medications, too many to list. I have had trigger point Injection in my occipital nerver, did bio-feedback, time on medication & time off (to dismiss rebound), I have elmintaed foods, smells, anything that may be a factor.The headaches aren't defined either - they range from a ""typical"" migraine to cluster to tension.I am on narcotics now and just can't take it any more.    They are getting worse.    I just had an MRI and waiting for results.    I can guarentee nothing will be there and I will continue with this horrible pain.What can I do? What is this?

GOAL	macular holes	I am a 49 year-old female who about 1 year ago was diagnosed with macular holes in both eyes. My eye Dr. noticed some changes and referred me to a specialist.    I had also noticed some distortion particularly when reading even when using my reading glasses.        Because the macular holes were so small and my vision was only mildly distorted and my overall vision was still good, the Dr. suggested a follow-up appt. Strangely enough, the right eye vision seemed better with little to no distortion and the left eye became more distorted.    The Dr. said sometimes they can improve or get worse.    Now I am going back to see the Dr. after 6 weeks and they discussed the possibility of surgery.    Of course after researching all this, I am certainly not thrilled with the surgeryand esp having to keep my head down for at least one week.    First, do you think it is a good idea to get a 2nd opinion, not that I have any competency concerns with my current Dr,. but when is it really necessary to have the surgery?    I understand that this usually occurs in older people and it is uncommon to have this in both eyes at the same time, at least that is what my Dr. had told me also.    Just my luck!!!    I also was reading about a new procedure using silicon oil instead of the gas bubble to repair the hole.    Do you have any information about this other procedure?    Thanks for your time.Nadine	macular holes|said|diagnosed|left eye|procedure|overall|eyes|head|eye|back|gas|right
SOCL	Soaring temps might press utilities in eastern US	"By DEEPTI HAJELA, Associated Press Writer Deepti Hajela, Associated Press Writer Ã¢ € “ 2 hrs 11 mins agoNEW YORK Ã¢ € “ With a scorching holiday weekend in the rearview mirror, a real summer sizzle is about to wash over parts of the United States.After an extended Fourth of July weekend when temperatures inched into at least the 90s from Maine to Texas and into the Southwest and Death Valley, the mid-Atlantic is embarking on a string of intensely hot days, with temperatures in some places closing in on 100-plus degrees.Temperatures could reach as high as 102 degrees on Tuesday, meteorologists said, and Wednesday was forecast to be the most humid day of the stretch.And unlike on the long Independence Day weekend, when utilities had lower demand for power, the masses returning to work Tuesday amid the possible record-setting heat across the Northeast threatened to push utilities usage to record levels.Demand was anticipated to increase when offices reopened Tuesday, said Bob McGee, spokesman for the Consolidated Edison utility in New York. Con Ed was preparing for peak usage to break the record set on Aug. 2, 2006, he said.In the East, warm air is ""sitting over the top of us, and it's not really going to budge much for the next day or two,"" Brian Korty, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Md., said Monday. After that, he said, a system coming in off the Atlantic Ocean would bring in cooler temperatures.Korty stressed that the danger from increasing temperatures was likely to grow.""As the temperature and humidity both get higher, the stress it can put on the human body increases,"" he said, ""and therefore the higher the temperature and higher the humidity, the greater the chance of people having problems.""One person affected was Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Tim Murray, who was hospitalized Monday evening after marching in five parades in 90-degree heat over the holiday weekend and feeling under the weather, his spokesman said. Murray was in good spirits but was to stay overnight at a hospital in Worcester, 40 miles west of Boston, for observation, spokesman Kyle Sullivan said.The weekend heat also was blamed for at least one death.Temperatures that pushed into the mid-90s across much of Michigan claimed the life of a homeless woman found lying next to a car in a suburban Detroit parking lot Sunday afternoon. The Oakland County medical examiner's office told the Detroit Free Press newspaper the woman died of hyperthermia, an abnormally high body temperature.In Indianapolis, which had a high of 90 degrees Sunday, police said they arrested a couple for endangering their 2-year-old daughter by taking her begging in the heat. The parents, who had $98 when arrested, were jailed Monday on child endangerment charges. The girl was treated for heat exposure.A major utility restricted water use on the New Jersey shore, forbidding residents from watering lawns and washing cars.About 17,000 customers in northern New Jersey lost power for more than four hours Monday, though Jersey Central Power and Light spokesman Jim Markey said it wasn't clear whether the outage was related to the heat.The high-90s heat rising up from the sidewalk on Independence Mall in Philadelphia on Monday had history teacher Joan Whalen eager to get home to San Antonio.""We went to D.C., too, when it was record hot (last week). I'm tired of the heat,"" said Whalen, 65, as she exited the Liberty Bell Pavilion.In downtown Newark, N.J., on Monday, where temperatures crept toward 100 degrees, sidewalks that normally would be teeming with pedestrians were practically barren. Street vendor Alex Gam, wearing a hat and sunglasses to ward off the sun, lamented being outside in a spot devoid of shade for several hours with little to show for it.""There's no business today, it's very slow,"" he said. ""It's too hot. Everybody's at the beach.""Just then, two women approached, and each bought a handbag, providing Gam a brief reward.In New York's Times Square, Jerryll Freels wasn't going to allow the heat to keep him inside on his vacation.The 28-year-old was combating the hot weather with a wet white washcloth over his head and a water bottle in hand.""It's hot, but I know how to stay cool,"" said Freels, visiting from Minneapolis.For others, though, there was no getting away from the heat.Richard Willis, 52, was one of a few dozen homeless men in Franklin Square, a small park in downtown Washington. He spent his day drinking water and staying in the shade.""That's all you can do, really,"" said Willis, who wore jeans and a long-sleeve shirt and sat under a tall tree near a fountain. ""I've been through many summers. I'm experienced.""The long weekend had loads of people out seeking relief. Five Connecticut state parks had to stop admitting people because they had reached capacity.___Associated Press writers Eva Dou and Samantha Gross in New York, Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia, David Porter in Newark, N.J., and David Melendy and Sarah Karush in Washington contributed to this report."	high body temperature|tired|hyperthermia|stretch|demand|Demand|Light|arrested|Franklin|said|heat|increasing|body|head|hand|lot
SOCL	How to Help Negative People	June 26th, 2006 by Steve Pavlina                     Email this article to a friendMany people have asked me how they can help someone whoÃ¢ € ™s stuck in negative thinking or depression.    Here are some tips on how to do that.No matter what happens, stay positiveI once visited the house of an old acquaintance, and as soon as I saw him, I felt a wave of darkness pouring over me.    I regretted stopping by almost immediately.    No matter how many times I changed the subject, he proceeded to spin every topic of discussion into an excuse to complain about what he disliked about his life, other people, and the world at large.    After 30 minutes I couldnÃ¢ € ™t take it anymore and had to leave.    This man was a major energy vampire, trying to get me to agree with all his imaginary woes in order to validate his victimhood.    His dissatisfaction was palpable as I refused to join him in his self-made prison, which only made him want to try harder.    But he was getting out of life exactly what he intended.    He was a victim because he thought himself a victim.One of the most important considerations when helping someone in a negative state is that you must avoid falling into negativity yourself.    Negative people are energy vampires.    They have an almost endless capacity to dwell on what they donÃ¢ € ™t want, whining and complaining about their lives while denying responsibility for their results.    Their fear blocks the natural flow of energy from within, so they must get it from other people instead.    After spending a few hours with them, youÃ¢ € ™ll usually feel drained, tired, worried, or stressed.    Positive people, on the other hand, have overcome their fears to such a degree that their energy flows outward.    Consequently, they give energy instead of taking it.    After spending time with very positive people, youÃ¢ € ™ll tend to feel energized, uplifted, and inspired.    Most people are somewhere in the middle though, so the energy exchange tends to be close to neutral.It makes no difference what particular circumstances negative people blame for their negative outlook.    Ultimately itÃ¢ € ™s still a choice rooted in free will.    No matter how unconscious the person was when making the decision to sink into negativity, in this moment that person still has the power to choose otherwise.    So if you decide to help such a person, your primary role is to help guide him to make a more conscious choice, one that will likely be much more empowering.How can you help negative people?When I was earning my lifesaving merit badge as a Boy Scout, I learned that if you want to save someone whoÃ¢ € ™s drowning, the last thing you should do is jump in after him.    Instead you should think through these steps in order:    reach, throw, row, go.    First, grab a pole or a stick and reach out to the person.    If the person is too far away or wonÃ¢ € ™t grab the pole, then try throwing him a life preserver.    If that doesnÃ¢ € ™t work, hop in a boat, row out to him, and extend an oar for him to grab.    And as a last resort, you can swim out to save him yourself if youÃ¢ € ™re trained in how to do that.LetÃ¢ € ™s consider how this same process can be used to help someone whoÃ¢ € ™s stuck in a negative mindset.ReachNegative people are a danger not only to themselves but also to those around them.    Consequently, itÃ¢ € ™s important to preserve your own state of mind while trying to help them.    You wonÃ¢ € ™t help a drowning victim by jumping in the water, flailing your arms, and screaming right beside him.    Yet some people use this highly ineffective strategy when trying to help negative friends out of depression.    Joining a negative person in a whining session only reinforces his negativity and makes you feel worse about your own life, even though it can temporarily make someone feel better to know he doesnÃ¢ € ™t have to drown alone.    Negative people have an endless supply of pity party invitations.    If you receive one, donÃ¢ € ™t RSVP.If the person isnÃ¢ € ™t too far gone, you can reach out and try to hoist him back up to a more positive state.    This is best used on people who are within range of you, especially someone whoÃ¢ € ™s normally positive or neutral but has become temporarily lost under a pile of fear and worry.    Reach out to him with a kind gesture.    Do what you can to cheer him up and bring him back to the positive side.    Invite him to an upbeat social event.    Take him out to eat and talk about positive memories together.    If he tries to get you to join him in his negative thinking, donÃ¢ € ™t.    Keep the discussion positive as you coax him back to shore.Sometimes when my wife starts to lose it (which can happen at certain times of the month), I get her to stop whatever sheÃ¢ € ™s doing, and I give her a 5-minute foot massage.    This usually succeeds in bringing her around because it switches her focus.    Given the option between focusing on her problems or focusing on her feet, she chooses the feet so she can enjoy the pleasure of the massage.    By the time the massage is over, she may not be totally happy, but sheÃ¢ € ™s at least feeling more content.Reaching out to someone in a negative state is effective in combating mild or temporary negativity.    Sometimes a kind word and some attention from a friend is all thatÃ¢ € ™s needed to turn things around.    But when this solution isnÃ¢ € ™t effective or appropriate, then we move on toÃ¢ € ¦ThrowIf the person is a bit farther out in the sea of negativity, you might not be able to reach him directly.    Perhaps he refuses your initial attempts to help him.    Maybe heÃ¢ € ™s in denial of the problem even though itÃ¢ € ™s obvious to everyone else.    In this situation you can try a more indirect approach by throwing him a life preserver.Ask a mutual friend or family member to intervene.    Send the person a book or CD you think may help.    Write him a card or letter to remind him that you care.    You can even use cards and letters with someone who lives with you, which often works well when verbal discussions are too easily derailed.    Get creative or do something humorous to help interrupt his negative pattern and bring him back to the table.    For example, record a personal audio message, and sneak it onto his iPod.If your first throw doesnÃ¢ € ™t work, keep tossing until the person grabs on.    But if the attempts begins to wear you out, you can make one final toss, and say, Ã¢ € œThatÃ¢ € ™s it!    Either you grab the life preserver, or IÃ¢ € ™m cutting you off.Ã¢ €     Sometimes an ultimatum is the only way to get the personÃ¢ € ™s attention, but donÃ¢ € ™t use them unless your other attempts fail.Many years ago one of my wifeÃ¢ € ™s friends was in a destructive downward spiral, frequently hurting herself and others.    After various attempts at trying to help her, my wife decided to write her a long letter.    In that letter she expressed her feelings about this womanÃ¢ € ™s destructive behavior, offered the best advice she could, and said that their friendship had to end as a result of this womanÃ¢ € ™s choices.    My wife realized she had to let this friendship go, but she attempted to toss one final life preserver in the form of that letter.    For years we never heard from that woman again, and then out of the blue she contacted my wife again.    The woman relayed how my wifeÃ¢ € ™s letter had a powerful transformative impact on her.    It made her take a hard look at herself and became the impetus for turning her life around.    Even though her initial reaction to the letter was far from positive, in the long run she was grateful for it.http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/06/how-to-help-negative-people/	discussions|discussion|lifesaving|massage|cutting|remind|tired|hand|foot|feet|pole|arms|back|order|pile|said|right
SOCL	Risks of rimming - when she has no STDs	I posted this in the STD forum, but a poster there suggested that I post my question here.I have a question concerning rimming. I'd like to lick my girlfriend's anus (the outside, I wouldn't go in there.. :))Neither of us have an STD. She is vegetarian, so she does not eat meat or fish. (This may be relevant, since she can't have some infections or parasites that come from bad meat.) I will only do it after she has showered.I'm wondering if there is any knowledge out there on what my chances are of catching a disease, what those diseases are, and if they are treatable or incurable and how severe they are. Is my risk negligible here? Has anyone ever actually caught a bad infection from rimming, that wasn't a 'normal' STD?Thanks so much for your help!	infection|diseases|STD|disease|catching|anus|severe

One research found that 60% of elderly women    experience muscle cramps with Norvasc. A pharmacist suggested to supplement with Magnesium and Vitamin C to lessen the cramps. Would that help?

FAML	My 3 yr old son will not listen at preschool	"My son has been attending a Christian Preschool for the past 8 months and has had consistent bad behavior in school. They all love him there but it has definately been a battle with him listening. They tell me that he refuses to listen to his teachers and tells them ""no"" when he is asked to do something. He has a hard time at lunchtime, they tell me that he likes to be the center of attention or ""class clown"" by throwing his food on the floor and showing his food while it's in his mouth. He has also hit and kicked his other classmates while attempting to wrestle with them. A little background on us: I have an older son, 7 yrs, who is in wrestling and other sports and the both of them love to wrestle and fight with each other, normal things that brothers do. He misses him very much because they only see each other on weekends and once a week. (They have different fathers and my oldest is with me part time). My 3 yr old's father lives in another state and rarely sees him. I am a single mother with a full time job which means that he is in school full time. I realize that these may all be factors in his bad behavior but I have no family up here whatsoever and the closest family lives in California (I am in Washington State). When he is at home with me, other than the occassional common disobedient behavior that a young child often displays, I am at a loss as to what to do, and his teachers are ""at their wits end"" with him as they tell me. I am going down to his school on my lunch hour today to talk to him but I don't know if that will work, as I have done this many times. The school has even tried smily and sad faces every hour, they would give him whichever one would apply each hour, thinking that by taking it in small incremints, it might help. Any suggestions?

FAML	Behavior quirks in a very competitive 11-year-old	"SITUATION POINTS:We have a very competitive 11-year-old gymnast who trains 30 hours/week, 6 days a week. With our 2 hour round-trip commute to the gym, this is a 42 hr/week commitment.Given the training, we home-school.We consider ourselves very balanced, loving parents and give our little gymnast plenty of slack. We have another child, 17, who has turned out fine, even through the difficult teen years. No stress, no issues, good focus and habits, polite, etc... Our gymnast is sweet and has a good heart, but is extremely difficult to manage sometimes. And perhaps partly due to the psychological make-up of being a competitive sports child, our gymnast tends to be self-centered and very self-confident.THE ISSUES:Our gymnast can never be wrong, and always blames someone else. If we have to install penalties for behavior issues, it's because we didn't do something or we changed something, etc...Our gymnast won't ever ""finish"" anything at home. Literally the last mouthful of milk, juice or water will be left in cups. The last bite of sandwich will be left on the plate. The washed clothes will be taken into the room, but not put away. The homework will be done but papers will not be collected and scraps will be left around.THE QUESTIONS:We cannot get our gymnast to clean up or finish things completely at home. And with the ""blame someone else"" issue, when we institute penalties for not cleaning up or finishing something, the blame will be shifted and our gymnast will ""hate"" us for executing on our penalties.We are wondering ---- with such an intense competitive situation outside, could this ""not finish things up"" phenomenon be somehow psychologically related competitiveness? Should we maybe back off and just let these ""unfinished tasks"" continue to occur? Any ideas for other ways to try to fix the self-centered-ness and blame-others attitudes?We certainly don't want to damage our child nor do we want to impact our child's ability to perform in the gym. Our gymnast is on-track to be a very very good gymnast, probably ultimately in the top 150 or top 100 in the country eventually. Further than that is impossible to predict.Thank you for any helpful feedback!"	heart|back|balanced

TRMT	Vitamin D Symptoms Still Here!	My troubles began back in April 2012. IÃ¢ € ™d been dealing with some off and on pain in my hands and wrists. Then the pain spread to my shoulders so I decided it was time to get looked at. My doctor initially brushed it off as carpal tunnel and sent me off to physical therapy. It didnÃ¢ € ™t really help. I went back to the doctor for a full blood work up. Everything checked out ok except for my vitamin D which was at 11. I should be between 30-80 per the doctor. I was prescribed 50,000IU of vitamin D to take for 8 week to be followed up by another blood test. My vit D was raised to 16. I was ordered to take 5,000IU with another recheck in 8 weeks. That wouldÃ¢ € ™ve been in August, but I never made it. My summer got very busy and then with the holidays, time just got away from me.Fast forward to now. In December my pains really got worst. A LOT worst! IÃ¢ € ™m beginning to wonder if I might have arthritis or fibromyalgia. The pains I have now are mainly in my fingers, hands, wrists, upper arms, knees, ankles, feet, toes, upper back, and neck. ItÃ¢ € ™s not a constant pain. If I sit still, thereÃ¢ € ™s usually no aching, but when I move it hurts. ItÃ¢ € ™s worst when I sit or lay down for extended periods and then get up. I havenÃ¢ € ™t been sleeping through the night for the past couple of months now and when I do get up itÃ¢ € ™s painful to so much as just roll over in bed. IÃ¢ € ™ve been waking up every hour it    seems. I used to look forward bed time, but now I dread it! I started taking over the counter Unisom which has helped. I still wake up a few times during the night, but not as often.I went yesterday to get my recheck done that was due in August finally and the results came back showing my vitamin D was at 53. Now IÃ¢ € ™m over the low range, but IÃ¢ € ™m still in so much pain! Could my pain issues still be caused by vitamin D? How much longer should I have to expect to live in this pain before persuing other tests for arthritis or whatever else would be causing my pains? ItÃ¢ € ™s been 9 months as it is and it seems to be getting worst not better. IÃ¢ € ™m really beginning to think itÃ¢ € ™s hopeless and that IÃ¢ € ™ll have to live the rest of my life in pain. This is not something that IÃ¢ € ™m looking forward to.One more thing to add. Every morning when I wake up I take 800mg ibuprofen, 5,000iu vitamin D, a mulit vitamin, a supplement with calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and I also just started taking a glucosamine w/chondroitin and msm supplement. IÃ¢ € ™ve read that magnesium should be taken with vitamin D, but that it shouldnÃ¢ € ™t be magnesium oxide as itÃ¢ € ™s not absorbed as well as other forms so I started taking magnesium taurate which caused a rash on my stomach. I stopped taking it.

DEMO	Could I be?	Okay this is gross and confusing but I need an answer. My ex and I had sex back in august and the condom broke. I was supposed to get my period Sept 13th but knowing that it broke worried me and I took an HPT 3 days before, it came back neg so I stopped worrying. The 13th came and instead of my regular flow I just got one discharge that was brownish like and stringy and disgusting. After that one time I've had nothing 2 more neg HPTs and still no period. Today I was sitting in my bed and felt like a pushing feeling in my upper stomach light right below my rib cage and instantly got scared. Any one have any idea if I could possibly be pregnant or if maybe I just missed my period and have nothing to worry about?	rib cage|stomach|light right|Today|back

FAML	4 year old with social problems	Hi -    I have a 4 year old girl in my class who is having a hard time making friends.    There are only 5 girls in the class, but the other 4 do not want to play with her.    I can see many of the problems - she does not share and often takes things away from others, she still engages in parallel play, often playing in the center but not with the other children. she also has a speech delay.    I feel really badly for her, and I've tried to encourage the other girls to play with her, but so far , nothing has worked.    The epitomy of it all was that they all had a play date aftrer school this week, but left her out.    What can I do to help?    I have addressed this issue with mom, but she has not been very open about getting help.    Is there anything that I can do to help include her in the group?	
GOAL	Worried About Dramatic Weight Loss	"Hi, I am very worried about my husbands weightloss. He has lost something like 30 kilograms in 3 months, and I kept asking how he did it, but he just would say, ""I dont know?"".I was worried he had cancer or something, until i found    http://bestproofonline.Com/?9v1p in his browser bookmarks which proved for me that he has been taking PHENTERMINE!My question is this: Is this safe????????Also is it addictive. I will admit he looks terrific, I am just worried about the consequences of such rapid weight loss!"

FAML	5 year old attached to	"Hello. I was talking with a friend on the phone today and she mentioned something i thought was rather strange. she has a 5 year old daughter who has become very attached to her sisters boyfriend. (my friends sister that is). The man is 28 years old and gives the child more attention than the my friends other 2 children. He buys her things and takes her places without the other kids. I think his intentions are innocent of course but she said that her daughter has become obsessed with the man. She talks about him all of the time and wants to see him alot. this could be because he is nice to her. i got uncomfortable about the situation today when my friend said that her daughter was over her sisters house and was trying to make attempts to see the man naked. The first attempt was the man was in the shower and the girl kept insisting that she needed to urinate. When the man exited the bathroom the need to urinate was over and she then wanted to enter the bedroom he was naked in. she was being playful when he walked through the hallway with a towel on and said ""i wont look"" but peeked as if she would see something. I know that toddlers are curious. I might be looking too far into it but i was just searching for an answer. my question is: is it normal for a child to become obsessed with a member of the opposite sex who is not their parent? My friend tried to tell me that i should have learned it while i attended college for psychology, but we never went over this topic in child development."	said
DISE	Visual Confirmation by Surgeon	"I found a hard pea sized lump in my breast before Thanksgiving and went and had a mammogram and an ultra sound. The radiologist thought it looked suspicious (BIRAD 4) and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed (due to implants they thought a core biopsy was to risky). I had it removed and after surgery the surgeon said that he thought it ""looked good"" but we wouldn't know anything for sure until the biopsy results are back. I guess my question is, can a surgeon determine just by looking at a tumor if it's cancer or not? I am assuming that since he does these surgeries often enough, he would know what cancer verses benign appears like just by sight. Or at least I hope. I am trying to calm my nerves while waiting for the results. He asked me if I wanted to see the tumor (since I had a local I was awake) and I said yes, he then proceeded to cut it open in front of me and it was yellowish on the outside and on the inside it was solid white and round and difficult to slice open. Looked like a nut.Thanks for any answers to help me through the waiting game.............."	core biopsy|surgeries|breast|nerves|cut|said|back

FAML	Behavioral Issues	I am a grand-mother to a lovely 5 yr old little girl that we have taken over full custody since the age of 3 months.    Within the last 3 years she has been developing several problems within the daycare setting to include, hitting, screaming, climbing on furniture, throwing of chairs and toys, telling the teachers she hates them or their stupid and should be fired.    She has been kicked out of 7 facilities, the local county people are involved and she is seeing a behavioral health person, who has prescribed adderall(adderrall), ritalin and today guanfacine.    I'm constantly having to leave work to pick her up.    She is massively disciplined at home sitting in time outs, staying in her room etc....however she is a lovely, extremely active child at home and is a typical five year old.    How can I curve these behaviors in daycare before she starts school in Sept.    Any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated	active|chairs

DISE	peroneal sensory neuropathy	I have just been diagnosed with superficial peroneal neuropathy as the cause of the numbness, tingling and pain in one foot, subsequent to knee arthroscopy a year ago.    The sensations haven't improved over the elapsed time.    The problem is that all the sensory nerve maps I can find indicate that the peroneal nerve innervates the top of the foot, not the bottom where my numbness is.    There is no motor involvement, it's totally sensory.    REALLY aggravating, especially since there seems to be nothing I can do about it.    And I went through the NASTY cattle prod/EMG studies just to come to that conclusion.But--does he have the wrong nerve?    Or is it a branch that innervates the bottom of the foot and he didn't bother to get that specific?    I hate it when MDs assume that patients don't know anything or will just accept any lame explanation.	peroneal neuropathy|tingling|knee arthroscopy|diagnosed|peroneal nerve|sensory nerve|nerve|foot|pain
SOCL	Just trying to get through it....still.	My dad died of a massive heart attack at 54 which came as a complete shock to everyone.    He had always been healthy and fairly active. I was only 21 and still in college, just about to graduate, that was almost 3 years ago. I'm 24 now and I'm still trying to work through it. I have always been a daddy's girl, and only child, and I took after him in many ways and looked up to him so much. I know he loved me so much because of the time he spent with me, but being a college student who didn't live at home but still in the same city, I didn't see him as much as I wish I had. I would still talk to him on the phone every Sunday and see him sometimes, but not enough. We would occasionally go to movies together that my mom had no interest in such as Lord of the Rings and the Matrix.    Even though I know he loved me, he rarely told me he loved me. I wish I had told him that I loved him more, but I really hope that he knew I did. That is something I do regret. I think about him everyday and miss him so much. When he died, I was in complete shock. I sometimes still can't believe he's gone. There are so many times when I'll see something that'll remind me of him and just lose it and start crying still. I don't think I'll ever get over it. What makes me extremely sad is that he wasn't able to be there when I graduated college, when I got married, and he won't get to be a grandfather when I have children. I just know he would have made a great grandfather - the fun kind. He was always funny when I was growing up, joking around and being a prankster. I have wonderful memories, but I grieve for the memories that we'll never have. It hard to lose someone so suddenly and unexpectedly. I didn't get to say goodbye. He was gone before I got there. It has gotten easier, but I relapse all the time and feel exactly the same as I did right after he died.	heart attack|relapse|remind|active|right

FAML	9 year old Anger issues	I am at a loss....my 9 year old child has been diagnosed with everything from bi-polar to ODD to one Dr. saying its just the way I raise him.    He has anger issues that I can't explain.    He is a very loving and caring child.    He is helpful with other kids and seems to have no issues at school.    He gets angry at the wildest things.    Like not getting his way, or losing at a ball game, or not doing good at a game, if he gets hurt or someone hurts him.    But not all the time.    Only on certain occasions.    He almost gets this glared over look and loses control.    He will hit and kick things, but never another person.    Every Dr. I have taken him to does not seem to know what is going on.    Just looking for some advise.    I should add that this has been an issue since he was 4 years old.    Lisa	diagnosed|glared

That was in April 2005.    Since then he has been doing well heart wise.    He has had some other health issues.    Severe eczema pre-op, multiple food allergies post op.    Life is never straightforward with my little guy!In the last week hubby & I have noticed that he has crooked pinkie fingers on both hands, but more obvious on his left hand.    He also has sandal gap of both feet, a large gap between his big toe and next toe. We think he may also have Brushfield spots (a concentric ring of white dots around the outside of the iris), but have not confirmed with an optician or opthamologist.    All of these can occur spontaneously in people and not mean anything, but they are also known to be soft markers for various conditions or syndromes.    We just find it a bit strange that he has all of these and yet, appears to be a ""typical"" toddler.We are due to see his paediatrician on monday and wondered if I should mention my concerns.

PREG	Is it possible that a blood pregnancy test gives a false postive?	okay so i'm new here, and i am very confused... i took three urine tests, and one blood test... all came back negative. over the last couple weeks, i have been extremely tired, i have been nauseous, i have been getting headaches on & off (with no logical explanation as to why i'm getting them), my breasts seem just slightly heavier, my nipples are almost always erect, the area around my nipples has gotten just a bit bigger, and also darker, i have been dizzy lately, also, i can just be sitting around doing absolutely nothing, and i will all of a sudden feel like i am going to get sick to my stomach. i am now 6 days late for my period (i am NEVER late), the day after i was supposed to get my period, i got light bleeding, which lasted about a day and a half, maybe two days. it was not constant at all. my periods are never that light, nor are they ever this late. my family seems to think that i am making this all up, but i know i'm not. i got pregnant last year, and ended up having a miscarriage. i did not realize i was pregnant until i had the miscarriage, but i still would be able to tell if i'm getting the symptoms... also, when i was younger (about 6 years ago) i was going through some tough times, so i taught myself to only eat once or twice a day, and no matter how much i tried to eat more over the last 6 years, i just couldnt do it. now all of a sudden i am hungry constantly, for the last week i have been eating at least 3 times a day, all three meals. its so unlike me. my mom thinks that maybe i'm just gaining an appetite for no reason at all, i however know different. is it possible that i may be pregnant & the blood test gave me a false negative?	headaches|nauseous|symptoms|hungry|tired|dizzy|breasts|nipples|stomach|back|light

GOAL	Edge glare after cataract surgery	I had my surgery to remove my Restor lens on 1/6/11. I was supposed to get the Acrysoft Alcon monofocus clear lens put in (not the yellow tinted one). My doctor came in the room before surgery and said they don't make the clear one anymore and instead gave me a lens made by Abbot instead? I take it they make the Rezoom as well. The surgery went good and my vision seemed to be much more clear than with the Yellowish Restor. I of course lost my near vision but I can live with that. My problem is however below. Please advise if I can do anything to change this. I plan to do the other eye in a few weeks.1. I have quite a bit of edge glare from lights all around the edge of the lens. Will this actually go away, or will my brain just eventually not pay attention to it? Will it not go away until I get the other eye done? Is there anything to do about this? Could it be the lens isn't big enough for my eye, or would it have been better if I would have used a Alcon lens?2. At night or in dark rooms I get a lot of glare and rings (like fireworks). It seems to get better once I am in the dark for about 10 or 15 minutes. Is this because of moisture from the cold weather? Does it go away once my pupil gets used to the dark? Will this go back and forth all the time when I go from light to dark areas? Will these symptoms go away? Because they seem to get worse each week? Is it because I am not using drops anymore? I went off my Durezol the other day and will be on Bromday for another two weeks.3. It seems after two weeks that my distance vision has decreased a little. Will laser help this? or does this just happen to all patients once your brain adjust to the lens? If I get laser will my near vision get farther away as well?Thanks, Bobby	symptoms|glare|brain|pupil|eye|lot|lens|said|lights|light|back|15 minutes|can live

DISE	Do I really have Endo?	I've always had bad periods since they started. Especially really bad debilitating cramps that no pain meds would help. Over the past year I've had unbearable aching stabbing pelvic pain that alternates from front to back pretty much all month. I thought it was from my hips which have been out of alignment since I was a child though supposedly therapy helped fix it.So I had some chiropractic work but it didn't help. I went and saw OBGYN, he did a pelvic and it was really painful for me which it usually isn't that bad. I had an Ultrasound and he didn't see any cysts or fibroids. But he decided Endo was a possibility since my Aunt has it and I'm rather sure my mom has it too.So I've been on BC for 6 months, it seems to ease the pain a little and I was almost back to my daily life. Sometimes I'd have really bad recurring pelvic pain though, usually in stressful situations. Nothing helps with it during the pain, no pain meds (mind you I don't have health insurance so I can't afford stronger pain meds). I was also on Cymbalta after having a mental break-down because I couldn't deal with the horrible interfering pain anymore in my life that would hardly let me leave the house. I've also struggled with high anxiety and depression since I was a teen. When I started having the weird pelvic pain, people thought that was causing it as well as all the stomach stuff I've been having over the years but the Cymbalta alone didn't do too much. It helped me stay calmer and they gave me Serqueol because I was having such horrible pain I would be up all night in pure agony. I was lucky if I got any sleep at all. But adding the BC seemed to finally help enough for me to sleep and hold a job.Now it's coming back    with a vengeance after I went off Cymbalta for a month, now I'm starting it again and the pain is unbearable. I don't know if it's coincidence that it got this bad after I stopped taking Cymbalta but if that were the case you wouldn't think it'd take a month for it to start effecting me. I started having really horrible dull aching pain in my pelvis, lingual area, and it radiates down my thighs and into my legs and alternates to my lower back and sides again. I'm also tired a lot and get lots of headaches and occasionally get dizzy. I don't have bleeding between periods, though I did have spotting once and I bleed rather heavily during periods but not as extremely as some people describe around here.I don't have the money to get surgery right now, so I can't know if it's Endo and I worry about saving my money for it and then wasting it when I find out I don't have it. I keep doubting myself and worrying it's something else and there's nothing I can do about it. Does it really sound like I have Endo? I've also suffered from awful IBS symptoms since I was a teen, alternating constipation, heartburn and diarrhea which I finally got under control, mostly, by using pyshilliam seeds. I was at the point where I had diarrhea about once a week or once every few weeks and then I suddenly started getting horribly constipated where I'd be so blocked up I'd be up all night in awful lower stomach pain waiting for it to come out so I would feel better. And before the BC pills, I used to have awful shooting rectal pain and worse than usual pain when I had a bowel movement. That's one of the things that have gone away since I been on the BC pill..Plz tell me I'm not crazy and doing this to myself, that it sounds like it actually is Endo because I'm sick of people assuming my body issues are all emotionally related!For years I thought I had some stomach disease instead and had a colonoscopy at 21 and saw these doctors when I still had medical insurance. Now I don't but I saw a GYNO during Christmas that my parents paid for because I knew something was wrong with me. I've never had this pelvic pain before until it started mysteriously last spring and it has not gone away. I've been in pain every day since and I can't recall a day that I haven't had any pain since last April. That's not normal and there's no way years of anxiety suddenly made me develop this new symptom, and I've always had bad periods so, it must make sense right??	stomach disease|wasting|cysts|Endo|sense|chiropractic|alignment|therapy|aching pain|constipated|headaches|heartburn|symptoms|painful|symptom|cramps|aching|tired|dizzy|pain|lower back|thighs|back|stomach|lingual|pelvic|pelvis|hips|legs|body|lot|Ultrasound|right
SOCL	Vaginal discharge and bumps concerns	Im 14. I am not sexually active, though I have been fingered before, but not in weeks.I have little lumps, not irritated I believe, on my vagina, somewhat near my vagina.I will get yellow-ish discharge, though I've always had that. My discharge cycle of clear to sticky, ect., is normal.I have had a minor UTI before. I solved the irritating peeing with cranberry juice.I have had my period for a long time.My discharge smells all the same. An odor, but not unpleasant. I think the odor is actually from urine...I drink cranberry juice whenever I can, and when I notice yellow discharge I usually change my underwear or I put on a maxi pad.	vagina|minor|UTI|ect
FAML	Is wetting pants at 4 years normal?	My stepdaughter turned 4 in July and just started peeing her pants all the time. She will hide and cry cause she knows better. She has been going to the bathroom on her own even when she just turned 3 years old. Her father tells her it's ok and never teaches her any different than that. Him and I have fought over it because I feel it is not ok to just let her do it and her think it is ok. Once she wet her pants and he changed her, he left to the store within minutes after that. She had went outside to play but only 10 to 15 minutes wet her pants again. I left her in them until her dad came back which was only about 5 to 10 minutes later. He was mad at me he was screaming at me and said I miss treated his daughter. Please give me some advise........ any!!	back|said|15 minutes|minutes

FAML	Changes in my son	"My son is 3.5 years old and until 1 month ago was a normal happy child.    At the beginning of December, he had an ear infection and then the flu, so I was home with him.    Then thru the holidays I was off on vacation for 1.5 weeks.    He has gone to the same babysitter for 2 years.    After he was ill the first time, we were sitting down watching a movie and eating a snack of goldfish, I took 1 cracker and he had a total meltdown, screming, crying, making fists and shaking.    This lasted for over 45 minutes until I pretended to ""cough up"" the cracker.    The a few days later, his grandma was over and we had pretzels out, she took 1 pretzels and the same thing happened, until she ""coughed up the pretzel"".    Last week we had eaten dinner and he ate alot and said he was done, when I rinsed off his plate he went into the same type of fit and tried to get the rinsed off stuff out of the pipes.    Also during this time, he would not go to sleep until between 12:00 and 1:00 am, no matter what I did.    Over the last few days, he has had fits over the toothpaste going down the drain, flushing his pee down the drain and all of a suddan not wanting to take a bath.    I have tried to reassure him.    The babysitter has had him get upset over crumbs on the floor and a drop of water on the floor. I took him to the doctor and he has an ear infection and the doctor had me start him on Melatonin to help with his sleep.    In hopes that with getting more sleep and clearing up his ear infection, he will get back to normal.    My best concern is that it seems to be getting worse, like he wants just my attention and that he is controlling me.    Also he has a step brother who was diagnised with Sensory Intergration disorder and now that he is 15 years old is a mess of behavior issues and I am worried that my son is starting to show signs of this."	ear infection|disorder|said|flu|shaking|fits|ill|fit|drain|bath|45 minutes|back
DISE	Chest pain	A few days ago my wife and I came down quite rapidly with some kind of stomach sickness and began throwing up roughly every hour for about 6 hours.    I had difficulty sleeping because of back and neck pains but my wife slept fine.    We are not sure if it was food poisoning for some kind of stomach flu as both were possibilities.    The following day we rested and kept hydrated and felt about 80% better before going to sleep.    I'm a 23 year old male, 192 lbs 6'4 and in good health.I awoke on the third day with mild pressure in the very center of my chest, about an inch above the nipples.    The discomfort didn't disrupt my day but it is noticeable.    My wife does not have these symptoms.    I do not seem to have any difficulty breathing and there is no additional pain when breathing.    My lungs overall feel fine.    Coughing causes a slight increase in discomfort.    When I bend down to touch my toes however the pain is more pronounced, particularly if I have been standing for a long period of time.    My shoulders are also quite sore.After mentioning these symptoms to a few people some suggest that it may be a heart condition.    Since this is only the first day of these symptoms I'm curious if they are related to the flu/food poisoning or if I should see a doctor, since the pain is really mild.	difficulty sleeping|sickness|symptoms|Coughing|pains|pain|sore|discomfort|stomach flu|condition|bend|flu|shoulders|chest|back|stomach|nipples|lungs|heart|toes|overall

TRMT	Serious complications with Mirena...anyone else have any answers?	I had my Mirena put in in early March of 2012 following a miscarriage. I had already had a child about 7 months prior, which was delivered via C-section. The heartache of the miscarriage combined with the realization of how hard it would be on my body made my husband and I rethink any new additions to our family at the time. we decided to wait another year or more in order to for my body to recooperate. So my ob suggested the mirena. It sounded like a miracle at the time, and possibly a solution all my problems. the first 4 weeks were normal, from what I was told. Just some decently heavy bleeding for the first 30+ days.    In late April, I started experiencing extreme symptoms which I could not explain. I had blinding headaches, sometimes so strong I would have to call into work. My mood swings were horendous. I was yelling at my husband, losing my patience with co-workers, and flying off the handle about the slightest things. One instance is when I was running behind for a photo session with our family photographer and became so irrate that I tore a picture off the wall and threw my shoe across the room, all while yelling at my husband.    I was losing sleep, constant anxiety, nervousness, forgetfulness, weight gain (even after started a doctor recommended diet pill and meal plan), pain during intercourse, occasional bleeding afterwards, unpredictable periods, and many many more symptoms which made day to day life miserable.I felt as if I was loosing my mind and had talked with my husband several times about seeking psychiatric help. I had chronic fatigue which effected my work severly, so evident that I was repremanded on more than one occasion. It is 7 months later as I type this, and the symptoms have not subsided. When I spoke with my dr about these, i was told that they were not normal side effects, therefor, must be caused by another source. My periods had become lighter and shorter, mainly only lasting 3 days with a moderate to light flow in the last few months. However, last month, I developed a few new symptoms that have terrified me. I have noticed a strong odor coming from my vagina, and a yellow film on the toilet paper when i wipe. I have been experiencing cramps more severly and more often than before, on one occassion so painful that I felt nauseated. I have been having a sharp shooting pain on occasion coming from my hip joints, pain and tenderness in my knees, back pain, and the headaches have left me unable to get off the couch at some points due to the crippling pain. I have noticed dizziness, and after a very short period of time sitting down, my arm or leg will fall asleep. I am worried that it may b an infection, or even worse displacemebt or the iud may be embedded. Can anyone give me any insight to this? I called my gyno to make an appointment, but they cant get me in for another 2 weeks. Any insight or suggestios would be most helpful.	pain and tenderness|shooting pain|headaches|nauseated|dizziness|symptoms|yelling|painful|weight|cramps|pain|nervousness|infection|vagina|light|knees|body|hip|arm|leg|back|order

GOAL	Halo Around Lights?	"I am a 25 years old female that has never experienced any eyesight problems from day one I was born.    Always had 20/20 vision and never needed corrective lenses.    For the past year I have experienced a halo or haze around street lights, car front/tail lights, etc.    My visions is very clear other than the halo/haze.    When the halo/haze occurs I test my vision by reading text of every size and variance of distances on street signs, license plates, etc.    All text and objects are clear in color and focus, just as they should be.    I had gone to the eye doctor 2 months ago, because I have been experiencing the halo/haze more frequently within the past 6-8 months.    The doctor seemed to have given me a very extensive eye exam, because of my concerns of the halo/haze.    I have cataract as well as glaucoma the runs in my family in my Mothers Father and my Father's Father. The doctor was very much aware of this during my exam and he tested my eye with various methods for cataract/glaucoma, and found nothing wrong with my eyesight.    He recommended that I try ""liquid tears,"" to test if that alleviated the symptoms.    I tried the drops and there is no success.    I work 8-10 hours 5 days a week in front of a computer, under regular office flood lighting.    During the exam the doctor was not able to make the symptoms happen with any of his tests and he felt I was young with no worries of cataract nor glaucoma.    The halo/haze is not painful at all, it's more of a major nu sense especially when I am driving with street lights, car lights, lit signs and skyscrapers.    Please help me!    This obviously is not normal, and I am very scarred that my eyes will be permanently damaged if what I am experiencing is not treated ASAP!    What should I do?    Who should I see?

I suffered with massive side effectsfrom these drugs daily. Last night I had something happen , that hasnt happend for over 2 years.it was unexpected !I for the first time in months, drank a soda pop drink, and was working normal, the weather has been very cold here, and I couldnt keep myself warm.    jacket and all.. Here goes! My belly got bloated from the soda pop, and I got some harsh aches going on for about 15mins.. I started burping loudand bleching -this did help in stopping the pains in my belly area.    however no sooner did I feel good, the bloating came back and more aches came on.. it pushed upwords to my chest area.. slightlythen it went to my upper back , center of the back and ached hard.. I rubbed it and it moved to theshoulders both sides !    and went into a spazum !    really hurt bad in both shoulders !I rubbed it out , in about 12mins.. and it was gone I felt good normal again for hours..however when I got home from work,    I was sitting at my desk and it started up again.. only worsebut only in the shoulders again !    no other pains !!     I had to take a relaxor to stop the spazums.. that worked pretty fast..    and I was able to sleep all night long.Im wondering If infact, TOprol or diovan    could cause this effect,    cramping and spazums..in shoulders and back area. ?I checked b.p and its normal    128/82        no chest pains anywhere near the heart !but did get a headache this a.m.     only slight..I hope someone can bring some light on this subject !    as iv had everyside effect from toprol xl and diovan .    one more wouldnt shock me !I see my doctor a new one, this friday.. so fingers crossed its a side effect    and not a big problem.	upper back|shoulders|chest|back|theshoulders|cramping|burping|aches|pains|fingers|heart|light

FAML	Is it reasonable to expect a 2 year old to stay focused?	"I have a son who just turned 2.    He is a delight the majority of the time.    He is very into singing, coloring, playing trucks and talking up a storm.    When it comes time to get ready in the moring.. it can be an easy task or challenging one.    He becomes attached to what ever he has worn that night to bed and getting him to take off his ""fish"" PJ's may make him cry.. ""NO, I want to wear fish"".    I have worked on this quite a bit and I pick out 2 shirts to change into..I say do you want to wear "" balls"" or "" stripes"" today.-it may take him 2 minutes to tell me or 20 minutes.    On the 20 minute days- he is going over to his books to read or do something not to pay attention to what I am asking.. I tell him, come over here- tell mommy which shirt you want to wear.. which ever you chose will be a good choice.. we can read books when we are done getting ready for school.    Sometimes I must say this 20 times. Each time a little more firmer - sometimes, I have to close the books or take them away or sometimes pick him up and try to get him back to focusing on the task at hand.    If I try to just over ride his decission making or just pick out a shirt for him- it is not worth it... he screams and crys.    If I allow him to make the choice- he is excited to put the shirt on and helps get himself dressed.    His routine is the same every morning- get dressed, turn off the night light, brush teeth and wash face- go get milk and then play. But some days it is exhausting and takes forever and other days- he is focused to the task and takes no time at all.    He is getting better- however, now the same type of behavior is occurring at school in the cafeteria for breakfeast.    His daddy takes him everyday to school and they have the same routine as well.. but now that he is 2 he sits with the big kids in the morning for breakfeast. He will sit to eat for only a minute or two and then is up running around or bopping his head to a song he is singing- but will not stay focused to eat his breakfeast.    All the other boys and girls are sitting nicely eating and he is just not focused to do so. My husband is getting pretty frustrated and feels this needs to change- but how and is it normal.    He is very focused on tasks "" he "" wants to do..but some everyday routine tasks he will do anything but that task at hand. What is reasonable to expect and any suggestions?He is also very independant and will tell you that he wants to do everything himself- and he is capable of 90% of most tasks required of him. He also is very proud when he has accomplished a task and will clap and say out loud "" I did it!"".    However, sometimes he will want help and if say Daddy is trying to help him - he will say "" no Daddy, mommy do it..

TRMT	really weird blood tests, MS, B-6 toxic, high ferriting (800+), messed up electro...	Hi all, Cindy from Alaska. dx w/ MS 1/08-no insurance for ages-finally got it and my ferritin is in the 800 and b-6 is 160. I am a vegetarian-lifelong. I was taking a multi-vitamin w/out iron as 4 years ago w/ ins blood test showed high iron. I have kids, pets and am single on ssdi and am sooooo sick. I eat really well, exercise, the rest of my tests were good-heart, cholesterols, b-12, D, kidneys, liver enzymes and hormones. I am going into menopause early -overnight.Fighting multiple sclerosis is hard enough this is beyond me. ache, dizzy, cramps, weak, cog-fog,major fatigue. how or could these be related? the high ferritin and b-6 does not even make sense....I am a parent and need to function-have no money but am resourceful. what chelates b-6 and iron? phlebotomy helps latter-how about former? I am only a soial drinker at best. I feel like my body hates me. what OTC, natrupathic, homeopathic, medical step worked to ease this and improve removal? I do have an ENT, Neuro., and GP working on this but it takes long. I am ready to get    leeches...I want this blood gone. any help, ideas, advice support is welcome on forum or PM. I cannot run a house, raise kids, fight MS, iron, b-6 all alone. it's just too horrible...oh I have HBP and eighth cranial nerve damage from MS as well.	eighth cranial nerve|kidneys|heart|body|menopause early|HBP|sense|phlebotomy|removal|leeches|homeopathic|cramps|dizzy|ache|weak|ENT|chelates

There are 3 left-sided thyroid nodules seen, two inferiorly at 8 and 5 mm and one superiorly at 6 mm. These nodules are heterogeneous and hypoechoic in nature. There is a 2.5 x 0.8 cm lymph node in the left aspect of the neck which has prominent fatty hilum and which has normal short axis measurement. No right-sided thyroid nodules. What should be done?

DEMO	Please reply quick. Breast tenderness and possible pregnancy?	Hiya,I'm new to this, I'm seeking some much valued advice/help.3 1/2 weeks ago I accidently messed up my birth control pills. I extended my 7 pill free day by one day as I didn't take the last pill in the packet. I then missed one a week later. I am due for my period one week from now.8 days ago experienced very painful nipples for about 4 days which then developed into very tender breasts (mainly on the outer side).I went to the doctor 5 days ago. She said my breasts were 'engorged' (does this mean suspected pregnancy in the medical world?) and to take a pregnancy test in 10 days.I have had cramps for two days, which feel like period pain two weeks before my period, and had a brown discharge after intercourse with my partner. I also had heart palpitations last week which my doctor suggested may be due to stress. I also discovered some rather lovely dry, elasticy discharge the day after intercourse. (Sorry if thats tmi)I took a pregnancy test one day ago ( I know this is too early but I couldn't resist) which came back negative.I have about another 8 days before I can take a test that will show reliable results and I would like to know asap. The thing that is really playing on my mind is what my doctor said about my breasts being 'engorged'. I know I should have asked what she meant but my mind was a bit blank to be honest.Thank you in advance.x	birth control pills|tender breasts|painful|cramps|pain|nipples|breasts|heart|said|pregnancy|back

FAML	20yr sister depressed, parents struggling	Hello everyone, I was hoping I could get some advice. My twin sister has been struggling at university for the past couple of years, progressively getting worse as time went on.She's now dropped out with 6 months left and moved back home with my parents. They're finding it very difficult with her as she is being incredibly moody (even worse than she used to be), angry, refusing to talk to them about anything, lazy, messy and not bothering to find job or work for my mother.She has been offered a job on a fishing boat for 6 weeks next Thursday that she has been wanting for a year to pay off her student loan, but now seems to not want to go or do anything else.My mum in particular is finding it very upsetting and is of course blaming herself, and I don't know what i can do to help as Ive moved to the other side of the world.I know where her depression has stemmed from, but I also know if nothing changes it's just going to get worse. How do you help someone who won't help themselves? What support and advice can I give my parents who are feeling very alone and lost?Any advice is much appreciated, thank you.	finding|back

PREG	HELP +OPK +BLEEDING=	Hello everyone. I am new here. I have always visited this site but this is my first post. We my DH and I have been trying to conceive for the last 6 months. This month we started using the opk since we were not getting pregnate in the months before I might be O-ing later that I knew. So I started my period and opk tested everyday once it stop. So for the first week and few days there was nothing not even a faint line or a evaporate line. I tested on 9/7 there was a faint line and the next day there was a clear positive ( both lines the same color). So we BD that week. That Friday I had some brown and light pink spotting. I was hoping that it was implantation bleeding it only lasted 2 days but it was on and off. So after that I had a lot of cramping but I knew that I wasn't due for AF for another 2 weeks. Well I still have been using the opk and once again there was nothing not even the faint line. Then 9dpo I got a faint line I tested everyday and the line got darker and darker. I took a 25mIU test and it was a BFN today I took 2 opk and they were positive. One had 2 faint lines but they were the same color then I took another and they were both the same color to. So now I think I am pregnant. I have been having some symptoms but I do not read that much into that because I think I have symptoms every month. Well today I laid down and I notice that I had some blood when I wiped and now it has gone away. So Now I am confused my Period is not due until tomorrow so I do not know if I should spend the money to get a test or if the blood was a sign that my af is on its way. What do yo think. Is the cramping normal what dose a positive opk mean?	implantation|cramping|symptoms|faint|color|lot|light
PREG	Doctor troubles..what do i do?	"hey girls i had a question, anyone been perscribed lo estrin 24 while breastfeeding? I wanted to get the IUD again at my post pardum check up, but my office was out for the time being, so they told me to call when i got my first period, i did and they were out...again, and the same thing happened again and again and i was begining to think that they were wanting me to get pregnant again lol, but i opted for the pill until they got some in, i assured the doctor that i was nursing, and would be continuing nursing probably for the next year (haidyn is almost 5 months old now) they assured me this was the pill to take, they were really rude about it acting like i was too impatient to wait until the iuds came in, anyways i asked them if there were any instructions i needed since this was my first time with the pill, they said "" its a pill, you just take it"" so i took the packet home and read it, it stated that you should wean your baby BEFORE taking the pill, so i called the number and the company told me not to take it until i was done breastfeeding, i called the doc back immediatly and told them what the company said, they told me just to take the pill and that the company is just not wanting to be liable for anything, so reluctantly i take the pill,i havent had any side effects so far, but the baby has been very fussy and not wanting anything to do with the boob, it has been a week and a half and shes still acting this way, so i call the pharmacist, they immediatly tell me to stop the bc pills and im not to take them while nursing, that im basically starving the baby because this pill is making my milk basically **** and diluting the nutrients, so i obviously stopped the pill immediatly (which is tonight) but the baby has developed a rash over her whole body, i am SOOO angry about this situation, i trusted my doctor and did what they said, and i now feel like they knowingly lead me to poison my daughter with whatever this pill has in it, i dont know where to go from here, if i should report my doctor for this or just let it go.....any advise? and what pill, if any, can i take while im nursing, i may be freaking out for no reason, and little miss haidyn may just be at a fussy stage that could be unrelated to the pill, but its just eerily convinent that she was a wonderful baby before and inconsolable the past week since taking it, am i crazy for wanting to do something about this?"	nursing|said|back|rash|body
TRMT	long term complications with tetanus shot	I had a tetanus shot in 1992 in the right arm. There was a small bump at the injection site that gradually disappeared in a year's time.I got my next one in 2005 in the left arm. It hurt and burned much more than 1992's shot. Once again a bump formed at the injection site, but it did not go away.I got a flu shot in 2010 in the left arm. The man who did it said he preferred the left arm because he was left-handed. I pointed out the bump, and he said that was no problem. He said it was just the same kind of scar that smallpox vaccine receivers got.Now in the last month the bump has decupled in size and become sensitive to the touch. I can no longer lie down on my left side. Before I go to the doctor, I want to get a preview of what bad news I am in for.	right arm|arm|injection|smallpox|said|flu

Almost had my normal appendix removed at age 30, was sureI had a bad cervical disk in my 40's, thought I was going crazy (as I was smugly patronized by my lazy provider ) in my 50's after my wife died from cancer and I smacked my head accidentally while hiking....boy. did that flare things up!!...anyway, I finally demanded an MRI after 3 months of constant nausea,    severe true vertigo, sore throats, choking episodes and basilar headaches... now I watch the symptoms parade by, excuse myself if I fart too much, take my prevacid and Ibuprofen as needed, and laugh when I can.

FAML	Behavior is getting worse..	My son has always had a habit of acting out and being overly aggressive during school. He can be over-exhuberant at home with his 2 yr old brother but nothing above the ordinary (bickering over toys, movies, etc.) however as soon as he gets on the school bus for school his behavior becomes aggresive(aggressive)and disruptive in the extreme. He has come along way academically however behavior-wise he was improving    (still had some issues with playing near the group but not really joining in and also losing focus in excitable circumstances) but recently he has become more and more aggresive(aggressive)(recently suspended for hitting a boy for threatening to tell the teacher for line-cutting) yet he can not tell me why he hit him. He knows verbally right from wrong but I am beginning to wonder if he actually grasps what those mean, as he does whatever pops in his head at any given moment.Can the school bring in someone to observe him and work with him to help me to decipher what the problem might be?? I am in the process of getting his pediatrician to monitor him, but as his home and school behaviors differ so, I want to know if the school can get started as it takes time to get into those programs and tests?	excitable|cutting|head|and tests|programs|right

The last time that something like this happened was when I was 11 I had a very heavy period that would last 2 weeks, but the doctor asured me that it would go away. This has been happening the past 3 months. I have stressed due to my living situation, school, and my relationship with my boyfriend. My period was really light and was odd because it would be a l ittle heavier. then the following month it was gone. I'm    starting to become scared now. Lately it seems that it would last only a few hours and come back. I started again and I thought at least that It was okay it seemed to be get alittle heavier., but a few days later I'm spotting everyday only for a few hours. I have been trying to de-stress by simply doing things that will calm me down, i'm eating healthier. But nothing... my period is like a facuet it will only be short for a hour. I'm afraid of leaving the house without a napkin or tampon. I'm really scared now.... I'm worried that it could be pregnancy but my boyfriend and I always use protection and the condom has never broke.

FAML	5 yr old Boy .. non social at school	"My son just started Kindergarten a few weeks ago and every couple days the teacher sends home notes that he was having ""outburst"" and was defiant.She has told me he is very intelligent but becomes overwhelmed with anxiety easily, he screams and yells at her, and often only works well one on one. Teacher says he doesnt pretend, however at home he pretends almost constantly and builds with legos and such daily. She said    He does not participate in group activites or socialize with peers, which makes her believe he will fall behind or struggle in the future. I have had him evaluated for autism before but the school is demanding I get it done again.At home he doesnt listen all the time but he does what is asked of him. He does homework when told, cleans up, goes to sleep (no issues with sleep), brushes his teeth alone, etc. To be honest I feel she is railroading him for no reason. He is an only child and I will be the first to admit very spoiled.     I can't help feeling its more of an adjustment issue over anything else.    Any ideas what it could be? I am at a complete loss and I am so stressed daily I cant stop crying.Thank you for any help!"	demanding|adjustment|railroading|said|yells

I underwent a total Thyroidectomy in November and RAI, I131 3700mbq treatment in Febuary of this year.I have today had a 6 month post treatment scan with RAI, I131 182mbq just to check how well the treatment went and whether or not I need more RAI treatment.Recently, whilst browsing the internet, I read somewhere that that prior to a Thyroglobulin test I would need to be off T3 for 2 weeks or off T4 for 4 weeks prior to the Thyroglobulin test.I know this is correct prior to the treatment and for the small amount of RAI with scan, but is it correct for the Thyroglobulin test also???The only Thyroglobulin test I have had was about 6 weeks post treatment after re-starting T4 the day following treatment, therefore, I had not been starved of T4 at all.Please could you tell me the correct way to test for Thyroglobulin, as I would like to think I am having it done correctly, with the correct results!.Many thanks for your time,Kindest Regards,Heather	Thyroidectomy|treatment|diagnosed|scan|correct
FAML	Bossy 7 year old...	"Hi.My ds just turned 7 a few weeks ago.    I have noticed that he is so bossy when playing with his peers (ie--a boy from school spending the night...playing football outside).    When he is with his cousins, who are a couple years older, not so bossy.    He gets down right rude and it isn't nice.    He is an only child and does GREAT in school but I'm afraid if he continues this bossiness he will have no friends.    We don't live in an area that has a lot of kids in the neighborhood so he spends a lot of time with his Dad and I playing.    He is extremely competitive too.    I am well aware of this and try to praise effort not outcome in whatever we are doing.Can I do something differently to teach him?    I try to teach him empathy but am unsure he ""gets"" it.

DEMO	No period for atleast 45 days??	ok this is a little complicated... i have been off BCPs now for about 9 mo. and having unprotected sex since then. i was having very normal periods lasting 3-4 days up until mid march i think? i never really pay attention what the date is when i have my period but i do remember not having one since march 15th maybe even earlier, im not sure. i have taken 3 or 4 HPT and all are negative. so it has been almost 45 days with    no periods... i have had a little nausea throughout the day and headaches, a little hungier than usual but no defiante proof of pregnancy. i have had an increase in vag discharge, no odor and kinda thin and milky looking. i was thinking of waiting two more weeks which would put me at about 60days without a period, to cal the doctor and get a blood test. what does anyone think? i would really love a baby and hope i am pregnant, but i just dont want to get my hopes up... this no period thing has just never happened like this before~ i will take any and all suggestions i can get, thank you!	headaches|nausea|cal|pregnancy
SOCL	Scouting defies its own values	"An organization that purports to help instill values of responsibility for well-being of country, community and self in young men has failed to demonstrate those values itself.The Scoutmaster of Moraga Boy Scout Troop 212 refused to sign the paperwork that would recognize Ryan Andresen had achieved Scouting's highest rank of Eagle because the 17-year-old had come out as gay in July. The Mount Diablo Silverado Council, the local unit of Boy Scouts of America, then issued a statement saying that because Andresen ""does not meet Scouting's membership standard on sexual orientation,"" he is ""no longer eligible for membership.""A Scout must complete the Eagle requirements before age 18. Andresen, in Scouting since he was 6, turned 18 on Monday. It takes years of work for Scouts to master the personal, vocational and leadership skills required to attain the rank of Eagle. They each must develop, design and complete a project that addresses a community need or problem.Andresen, who had been bullied as a child, created a 288-tile ""tolerance wall"" at Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School to help other victims of bullying - a problem so pervasive, it has received special attention from President Obama.Community values are evolving as Americans confront and cast aside old attitudes. Even the U.S. military has dropped its discriminatory ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.An online petition asking the Boy Scouts of America to recognize Andresen's accomplishment and reject discrimination already has more than 369,000 signatures.Many former Scouts will tell you they learned teamwork and respect through Scouting. And at the heart of respect, lies tolerance of differences.http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Scouting-defies-its-own-values-3934236.php#ixzz28ulmBC6O"	heart

FAML	Transition to new pre-school	My son is 3-1/2 yrs old. He has been going to a home-daycare since he was 7 mths. After he turned 3, we put him to a pre-school. It was very bad in the beginning. He used to cry the whole day and after couple of days he started to sit at the corner of the class. Things improved later on after discussions with teacher but I guess the damage was done.The most crucial thing that went wrong here was his teacher. She was so dry and cold. First 2 days she was okay, she used to greet us when we walk in. But then it turned like its my duty to settle my son in class and leave, which never used to happen because he used to cry and cling to me. Then I have to tell her to please come and help me out.I would take some blame for not doing a good job of easing him to this new environment. I did take him to pre-school couple of times before first day. On first day also I spent some time with in the school befor saying bye. But I guess that was not enough.Also I noticed that when this teacher was absent and some other teacher was in the class my son did a lot better. he started talking to people and playing and even had his lunch.So I spoke to director of the preschool about these concerns and then we had a meeting with teacher. We asked her to be a little more open and affectionate during the first 5 minutes that we walk into the class. That change itself made a lot of difference. After that the crying stopped, although very reluctantly he used to walk into his class and sit along with other kids. His teacher had to litearlly pull him from me but still the sad time was only for 4-5 minutes. And then all of a sudden he was into a new class with new teacher. Then a new transition started.Things are better but not normal. Even after 6 mths he still clings and cries when I drop him to school.He doesn't like to talk about school. I try to ask him what he did at school, what is the color of his chair, did he play, color etc.. he replies to some and then just changes the topic. He acts very difficult at mornings ( to brsuh his teeth, dress up). I try to console him by saying that hew will be at achool for sometime and    that his dad wil pick him up after his nap-time. Talking him to like that helps a littel but then he says that he doesn't like school and wants to stay at home. I console him again    he agrees we get into car and then as soon as we reach the class he clings to me . Same routime everyday! Another thing I noticed is he doesn't like to walk into a group. Even when we have gathering at home with close friends, I've observed that when its at our home or when we are one of the first people to join the group, my son gels in pretty fast. But if we join in later and if by then his friends are all there, then he won't go to them. He will start clinging to me. I think this anxiety to join a group of kids is a factor in his adjustment to school.I'm planning to change his school as I'm really not happy with the support I'm getting from teachers and staff. Also I'm planning to go from Full-time to Part-time so that I can pick him up a little early.We have registered at montessori school.    Please help me on how I can make transition to new school better than previous one. I am aware that there will be challenges ,but I want some guidance so I don't repeat the same mistakes..	discussions|5 minutes|adjustment|clinging|color|lot
PREG	Down Syndrome	My doctor asked me last friday, if anyone has talked to me about having the Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test just to detect any defects about the baby having Down Syndrome. I said sure i guess. Then i got home and read up on it. MY DOCTOR DID TELL ME THERE A POSSIBLE RISK OF MISCARRIAGE! the book i have says the risk is between 1% and 2%, but its still a RISK.    And i dont want to loose another baby. And even if the baby turned out with Down syndrom(syndrome)(god for bid) i really dont think i would get rid of it. you kno. another thing...im not even 18 yet and statistics say:at age 25 the risk is 1 in 1300 births. and they increase with age. so theres not really a great chance. and my mom and i cant come up with anyone with Down syndrome or any genetic abnormalities. and i dont think my ex (babys dad) has anyone in his family with Down syndrome or anything like that.so im not sure what i should do. if i should have the test or not. is it worth it? would i want to terminate the pregnancy? I dont think so. so maybe its not worth it?! i dont kno. im very confused	Down Syndrome|said|Down|pregnancy|syndrome|Chorionic|sampling|villus

FAML	Hospitals, Aides, and fall prevention	I have been involved with a number of very elderly stroke-disabled patients and have found that the hospitals are not set up to deal with them - even those with geriatric wards. The problem is strange surroundings, a very elderly stroke-disabled patient, and a high bed and a hard floor. When agitated, especially at night, they may climb over the bed rails and fall to the floor and injure themselves.    Because of hospital policy they generally will not use restraints, and if they do they will use wrist restraints which cause the patient to become extremely upset. The answer is to have someone in the room with them, especially at night. This person does not have to be a nurse or have any certification other than common sense. Insurance does not always cover such a situation. Ideally a relative should stay, but this is not always possible. What I have done is to hire female college students to sit overnight in the room. I set this up ahead of time and have several names to call on a contingency basis. I got the names by placing an ad on a card on the bulleten board of a nursing school at the beginning of a semester. If there is a problem they can use the call bell to summon a nurse. In the United States, if you are paying cash, this can be done very inexpensively. If you go through the hospital you will most likely find yourself billed for the services of either a registered nurse.	agitated|nursing|stroke|sense|wrist

He's extremely inquisitive, and always has a book in his hands.He is currently taking three different medications (one of them a stimulant), which help him ""control"" himself for a while, at least while he's in school.I have battled the school system for years to get him appropriate education, but they just keep targetting him as a problem child.    I feel that as he gets older, more issues appear, and I believe he has a bright future.I have been told that having taken Brethine (for pre-term labor) during pregnancy might have had an effect on what's happening to him today.

FAML	4 year old anger problem	"Hi! I have a 4 1/2 year old son who gets very frustrated easily. He bangs his head when frustrated and yells alot. He is a little delayed on speech. He speaks in sentences, he's just hard to understand at times. He yells and gets very angry when he is upset. When he does a behavior that I dont approve of and I tell him to stop, he yells back at me. IT makes it very hard to discipline him. If for example, I grab his arm and tell him not to do something, he yells and disobeys even more. My son only acts up when he doesnt get his way or is mad. Other than that he is a child who you can take anywhere, shopping, dinner, park, etc. He eats well, goes to bed with no problems at night and is very lovable. His teachers say if someone gets hurt at school, he is the first one there to comfort them. I am just confused because he is so good and loveable. He has NEVER been aggressive as far as hitting, etc. Its just when he acts up, it is so extreme. He just has ""weird"" behaviors. He also does not like to be comforted when he gets hurt. He has difficulty dressing himself and he is very obsessed with certain things, like directions to places we are going or our new van we just purchased. He talks about it all the time. Please help! I want to know if this is normal and he just has a strong personality."	speech|head|arm|back|yells

TRMT	Serious complications from Hysterectomy	I have had pure hell since I had a Hysterectomy in Decemeber 2010. I got very sick and went into the ER on Christmas EVE. I called the docotos office and talked to the doctor on call. He said someone would meet me there. My fever was 104 and in severe pain. I waited 2 days in hospital for a doctor to come see me and no one ever showed up. The Doctor came in the knew it was a huge problem. I had green/yellow puss oozing from incision. The doctor took a long wooden Q-tip and opened the wound. I was screaming for him to stop. It was like a horror movie and someone is running a knife all in your stomach. Blood and puss were all over me and my hospital bed. The doctor said we needed to go to surgery. He put some towels over this huge hole in my stomach to slow down the flow.I went into the surgery for 2 hours for be clean out. Doctor said he was going to leave the wound open to heal inside out. I laid in the hospital bed for 2 days with a HUGE hole(13.5 cm across and 8 cm deep)    in my stomach. The day I went home they put a wound vac in it and I wore this for 4 weeks (all of January 2011). This is a TERRIBLE PAINFUL pump and it has to be change 3 times a week.Now it is may and I started hurting, I told myself it was stress because it was the end of school year and I was getting all the Kindergarten things together. By the next week, I had a blood blister that was coming out of the incision. Went back to Doctor - he said to give it time and it looked good. I needed to lose weight. I was outraged! I left and went to get another opinion. The new doctor said it was not good and called the wound specialist. I had an appt the next day. I saw the specialist    and he said i needed to put the wound vac back on. It wasnt looking good. I incisison came open. Hole in middle of incision. You can stick a long qtip 10 cm left, 7 cm on right, and 4cm deepWhy is this not healing?

DEMO	41/2 year old can't feel when he has to go to the bathroom	"He can pee when you ask him to, otherwise he will wet his pull up and then sit in it until someone changes him. Sometimes he will poop on the potty but he's only done it a handful of times. I've been experimenting with him by first asking him if he feels like he has to go. He always says no so then I say well lets go try and low and behold he goes. When I ask him if he felt that in him and he says no. I've heard before in another case that the parents took their child to the doctor for the same reason and the doctor told them that it was because his ""plumbing"" wasn't fully developed yet. Could that be true?"	potty

About two years ago and once last night while I was falling asleep my head started feeling like it was out of air and my body felt like it could not move. Although when I tried to shake my head (to wake up) I had a mild uncontrolled body movement and then I was awake and very sleepy and was fine this happened a few more times until I eventually got up and woke myself up completely before trying to go to sleep again. After this I successfully fell asleep.

FAML	10 year old out of control	My 10 year old son's behavior is out of control.    He has a 13 yr old older brother and a 5 year old younger sister.    He feels the need to constantly mess with them 24 hours a day and cause misery to everyone.    He pretends to be creatures and animals all the time (attacking his siblings).    He doesn't realize safety issues - putting his sister where she might get hurt.    He will say and do mean things whenever possible.    And, he doesn't respect us - his parents - at all!    He talks back to us, always has to have the last word, runs from us, will not comply with anything we say to do at all.    It's very hard to discipline him - nothing seems to work - time outs, taking away privledges, items, etc..    even spankings do not work with him.    He will continue to act up    within minutes.    We try to give incentives - doesn't work.    It's like he does everything on impulse.    He has always been hard to discipline and has always acted up some.    He is very hard headed!!    But in the past few months it has gotten worse.    Since school has been out there has not been one day without confrontation with him.    Most of his problems tend to be around his siblings when he is by himself - he is better and he is very good at school and other people's houses.    What do we do.    We need help.	back|act|minutes

DEMO	yeast infection help ):	i'll try to make this as short as possible. i got my very first yeast infection for the first time this past weekend. monday, i started using monistat 3. after the final medication, the morning after, i used the bathroom and it burned a little, but that was the last of the burning. i was able to finally use the bathroom again without any burning, and there was no clumpy, smelly discharge. i'm also supposed to be ovulating soon, so i do see discharge that looks very normal and very healthy. but, here's the issue. i've gone to the bathroom three times today - first two times were perfectly okay. third time, it burned. i smelled the toilet paper to see if it had a yeasty smell, and at first, it didn't. i had to give it a couple good sniffs to actually notice that there was an underlying scent of yeast. the burning remained after i was all done in the bathroom and has finally faded. my question is, for those familiar with yeast infections or using monistat 3 - do you think that this means my yeast infection is just clearing up? or does that mean it's still there and coming back? the burning wasn't bad at all, it was very light, very mild, but the fact that it was there at all irritated me. i can't tell if it's just my body trying to get back into a healthy balance or if my yeast infection is still there. i have big big plans coming up soon and i can't be fighting a yeast infection. ):	yeast infection|burning|balance|back|body

DEMO	Help... painful lump in stomach	Hi everyone,I have a 3 inch width length and 1 inch height length lump in my lower right stomach. It is very tender and seems to be getting more painful and bigger as the days go on. I have seen two doctors, one of them thought it could be a cyst the other a    lipoma. Both of them do not believe it is cancer. I started having pain there about a month a go and like I said it seems to be getting bigger and more painful because before I hardly noticed it and could feel it only a little bit but now I feel it all the time and now even my mum and boyfriend can feel it, and my mum thinks it is also getting bigger. IÃ¢ € ™m so scared. I just cant get cancer out of my head, I had an ultra scan done 6 days ago. The nurse could hardly see or feel the lump and she could only slightly see it on the ultra scan    and she kept on asking me to point it out. She said she is almost certain it is nothing serious and probably just gristle like fatty tissue. But would it really hurt this much and keep on growing!?IÃ¢ € ™m a 20 year old female. I live a fairly healthy life style. I donÃ¢ € ™t smoke. I am a bit over weight (15stone and 5ft 8). I had a cyst on my right ovary which I found out about 8 months ago, I had the operation to remove it just over 2 months ago, everything was fine and looked great inside the surgeon said. I had a 6 cm dermoid cyst with hair and two teeth in it. They gave me a Laparoscopy so they could check out the surrounding organs and the other ovary and everything was perfect. I had an incision in my belly button (which has only stopped leaking from an infection) a 5cm line above my bikini line, a little incision on my left side and a incision on my right side, which is near my lump now. It makes sense if this is related to everything that has happened, but I donÃ¢ € ™t understand why it is getting worse.Any advice or understanding on the matter would be fantastic. I am so depressed and stressed out at the moment and its effecting everything!!! I am scared and suffer from anxiety disorder and I thought after having my cyst removed everything would be normal again.Em xThis discussion is related toLump between pelvic & stomach area.	belly button|right ovary|stomach|organs|pelvic|ovary|head|hair|discussion|operation|incision|Laparoscopy|infection|disorder|cyst|said|sense|painful|weight|pain|scan|right
FAML	behaviour of 5 year old	My daughter has been away at a recovery centre for alcohol and depression for 5 months.    I am looking after my grandchild who is 5 years old.    She has been through an enormous amount of emotional stress.    She only sees her mom once a month and when we leave she has the most awful tantrums for about a week. She loves her Mom very much and misses her terribly.    She sees her Dad every 2nd weekend when he can.    She is a very bright little girl and full of energy and fun.    Her behaviour has been slowly changing for the last 2 months.    Sulky, teary, disobedient, very manipulative and cheeky.    Her listening skills are just about zero.    My patience has just about run out.    I dont know how to discipline her anymore.    Nothing seems to work for any length of time.    I work every day and I dread going to fetch her after school.    Almost every night and every morning we have an argument because she wont listen.    I really need some advice on how to proceed from here.	manipulative|cheeky
FAML	6 year old girl being malicious to toddler	My 6 year step daughter has been getting more and more violent when playing with her younger brother, who is 14 months old. I always keep a very close eye on them playing together, because I have always caught her not being very nice to him. Just last night though it escalated dangerously (in my opinion)... I heard my son around the corner whimpering or something, so I went in to check on them playing and I found her covering his head with a blanket saying 'Shh it's ok...' I didn't freak out like would be second nature to do. I just firmly questioned what she was doing. She claimed 'I was trying to give him flowery hair with the blanket. And I was telling him it was ok if he wanted to take it off.' *Note: flowery hair because the blanket is flowery. So she was saying she was trying to make it look like the blanket was his hair. But the blanket was covering his whole head, face and all.* I am baffled. I am extremely frightened for my young son, but at the same time I do not want to shun my SD into a corner.It has been getting increasingly more dangerous like this, which is why I keep a very close ear and eye on them playing together. Then this morning, my son was playing on his zebra riding toy and fell off. Usually this toy is in the middle of the room, but this time it was pushed up to the heater and when he fell he hit his head on the heater and was stuck with his legs and head in the air (folding him in half). He could barely cry let alone breathe. Hubby and I were in the kitchen fixing breakfast when we heard a sort of metal thump and both went running. When we got in their room, we found him in that position, and SD was across the room sitting on the floor staring at him and snickering. Like it was funny!! Needless to say, hubby flipped out and began yelling at her. No swearing, just loud yelling about 'Why would you laugh instead of helping him or coming to get us?' etc. She then got a very long time out so that hubby and I could cool down and take care of the baby's head.A little later, we asked her why again, and her response was 'Because last night I had a bad dream and couldn't sleep well...' etc etc. I dont think this is the case, mainly because I heard her snoring all night on the monitor. And no sleep talking like her and her dad do. (That's when you can tell they aren't sleeping well). Oh and I almost forgot to mention, yes they share a bedroom because we can only afford a 2 bedroom right now, but they have always shared and there were no problems like this before. We also have another baby due in April (girl this time).I would appreciate any advice. I just cannot seem to get her under control. We have her on a waiting list for psychiatric evaluation, but we have no idea when that will be.	psychiatric evaluation|sleep talking|staring|cannot seem|close eye|folding|bad dream|yelling|snoring|head|hair|legs|ear|eye|flipped|face|right

TRMT	Clear Urine and Vitamin Supplements?	Hey guys. After having an array of weird symptoms, I decided to start taking a Stress B-Complex and an additional B-12 supplement. It seems that most people who take B vitamins get extremely yellow urine when the excess vitamins flush out, but my urine remains either completely clear or barely yellow. I do drink lots of water every day.Is this a bad sign? Or simply a sign that my body actually is deprived of vitamin B and using up everything I pour into it? Do I need stronger supplements?	excess vitamins|symptoms|flush|body

FAML	weird thing to say	My 4 year old son said that he didn't want to get married. He then said he was going to marry a man.    Does this mean he could be gay?    He has never said or done anything to suggest this, except this.    He is quiet at school, but makes friends and is quite loud at home.    I don't care if a person is gay, but I guess when I think it may be my son, I do worry.    The teasing, the not fitting in, etc.    I don't believe anyone wants their kids to be gay.    Why would they want to make their children's lives harder.    What do you think?    Perhaps, I am overreacting and I know sometimes kids say sill things.    A kid I know said she wanted to be a pony when she grows up or marry her mommy.    Any input would be appreciated.    thanks	said

DEMO	Bleeding after Orgasm - serious or not?	Hi, Im a 19 year old girl and Ive been bleeding after orgasming lately. Im a virgin and have never had intercourse, but have had oral. When I've been bleeding, its usually after masturbation - nothing is inserted, so I dont think its because of anything being too big. I also have a thyroid disease and am working on regulating my medicine. Because of it, I havent had my period in 2 months. Ive assumed at least thats why Im missing my period. But this random small amount of clotted looking blood after orgasming, has scared me. Any ideas on if this could be related to my hypothyroidism or if this is more serious?	thyroid disease|hypothyroidism

SOCL	1st Anniversary of Dad dying	Last year my father passed away suddenly of a massive heart attack at 63yrs old. It just happened to be my birthday when this happened. I have had an incredible hard year dealing with this, his death has stirred so many undealt with family issues for me. My birthday is coming up on May 19 and the closer it gets the more upset with anxiety and panic attacks. Whenever I start to get upset I want to run and go far away not be near anyone who knows it is my bday, I really don't want any bday wishes. For some reason I am convinced that if I can go away during the week of my bday it will be easier for me to deal. I have had so many things to deal with this year my health as gone down hill since dad died, I had problems before he died but since then I have got to the point of dealing with daily basics is somedays impossible. Please does anyone else have any advice to get through this first anniversary?	heart attack|May

PREG	am I pregnant?	I've been on birth control for a year, but this month I started my pack two days late, and I had unprotected sex then. That day I took the two missed pills and then I took the regular one at night. The next morning I vomited, and felt kind-of nauseous all day. And a day later I am also feeling nauseous in the morning.It has only been 48 hours, could I still take the morning after pill? And should I take it? Maybe the extra hormones are why I am sick, and the MAP might make it worse. I don't want to get pregnant, at least not for a few years yet.What should I do? Take the MAP or just wait it out?	nauseous|vomited
DISE	My most recent MRI	This was done 1.5 Telsa, if that matters. My MRI this summer showed enhancement and demylenation. This is a better MRI but I am still at a lose as to what is causing this ON again.LThere is a very subtle T2 hyperintensity within a non-enlarged right optic nerve. This is not as pronounced as on the prior examination. There is no abnormal enhancement at this time. The left optic nerve, and both and right and left retina are unremarkable. There is no intra or extra coronal mass on either side and the extra ocular muscles are normal in signal and caliber bilaterally. The pituitary fossa remains unremarkable showing no evidence of mass. Right frontal sub cortical punctuate T2 hyper intensity is not associated with edema or abnormal enhancement and is a nonspecific finding . Note that there isno white matter abnormality involving the brainstem or corpus callosum. This is an isolated puncatete abnormality. There are no classic findings of MS within the cerebral hemisphere. Posterior fossas is unremarkable.With regards to the optic nerve, this is an extremely subtle finding and would be equivocal for extremely mild edema without the supplied history of ON. However, when correlated to addition information such as abnormal brainstem evoked potentioal, or oliglcalnal bands on LP, mile ON would be the prinaty considerastion.    There is no restricted diffusion.Findings are subtle ON.	pituitary fossa|corpus callosum|brainstem|cerebral|ocular|and right|Right frontal|cortical|optic nerve|Posterior|retina|finding|findings|enhancement|enlarged|right

I was referred by my primary care physcian to at GI doctor after bloodwork was done.    I met with the GI doctor yesterday and he explained to me that my CEA level was 45.     I am scheduled for a colonoscopy on Monday but am really scared as everything i am reading says that normally anytime the CEA level is greater than 20 then it is usually a malignant type of cancer.

FAML	Could this be attention seeking?	Hi, my daughter is 10 years old, and I'm worried that she may not be getting the attention she needs because I am so busy with my 2 year old and 5 month old.    She has a blended family, my husband is her stepdad and she see's her dad on weekends mostly.    She claims that she gets in trouble all the time at home, and it makes her feel so bad, and her friends make fun of her because she is always getting grounded.    I do feel like my husband is a little hard on her sometimes.    And tonight, my husband restricted her from her cell phone, then she was mad so she didn't want to talk,        so my husband took something else away because she wouldn't talk to him about school.    Then later she got in trouble again by him.    She was so upset now that I found her hitting herself in the bathroom.    I do not think this is helathy.    Could this all be attention seeking behavior?	
DEMO	Worried Boy Friend, Girl Friend Is Spotting	"This has been covered time and time again but I feel I have to ask just to help put my mind at ease.My girlfriend has been on Ortho TriCyclin for about 4 months now and had a very irregular period before then. Since she started ""The Pill"" her period has been pretty normal.Earlier this month on the day she was supposed to start back on her active pills she didn't have them so she missed 2 pills. On the third day when she got them she took 3 pills that same day.I didn't know that she hadn't been taking the pills and we had sex two or three times. I ALWAYS use condoms no matter what because I'm overly paranoid but she is due for her period next week and she began spotting yesterday. Today she had some light brown sticky discharge.This is making both of us really worried. I've read that around 80% of women experience spotting and other things when missing 2 pills or more. Also I used condoms and I withdrew when I knew I was going to go.We took an early warning EPT test which ""says"" 5 days before your missed period and it was negative. Am I just being a typical guy and being overly paranoid?Any information would be great. Thanks."	Today|active|back

FAML	3 1/2 yr old son with emotional issues	It was recently suggested that we take our 3 1/2 yr old son to have a mental health evaluation by the preschool. He tends to get very angry-hiting, biting, kicking, scratching, threatening others, and when he is in new social situations he makes a very strange face, rolling his eyes up and starring away from people for about 15 minutes-I can't figure out all of his triggers, sometimes we'll all be playing nicely and all of a sudden he snaps-he's injured his brothers and sister, he's injured me. Regular punishments don't work, during timeouts he tries to break windows or bangs his head...alone time in his room he bangs his head on things. The teachers mentioned Aspergers? I worry this behavior will only get worse as he gets in to later grades in school.	face|eyes|head|15 minutes

FAML	5 yr old kindergartener w/encopresis	HELP!! What is the solution for the school/teacher when a child suffers from encopresis? He has daily BM accidents and is not himself bothered by them. He will, in fact, sit in his soild pants without a complaint. Because we are not allowed to toilet/change our students I call mom to come change him every day. Mom comes and changes him and he finishes the day. This seems like a bandaid as he is not learning to use the toilet.He is under doctors care to treat the constipation, but I'm wondering if sending him to a full day of school is appropriate at this time. It seems to make sense to have him attend a half-day session to allow him 8 months to work through this problem to be ready for 1st grade. I have tried a bathroom plan for him but he has serious issues w/toileting I don't think he's comfortable enough yet to work thru this at school. Obviously it is unpleasant for the rest of us but I cannot imagine the psychological effects it is having on this poor little boy! Is it possible for him to attend school while working thru this?	sense

Okay so... for all the complaining about PP bleeding I did, I stopped at 6 weeks almost completely, a few days more of spotting while on my trip (a gush here or there) but nothing major and then nothing at all...I went to work Friday and Saturday.... and now I'm almost 9 weeks PP (as of tomorrow)... and I started spotting yesterday (Sunday), which I assume should be my normal period time (never been regular but it is around the date of the LMP before Lilith)..Anyhow it hasn't gotten any more than spotting and barely noticeable... I threw on a pad expecting the flood gates of hell... but... nothing.Anyone else have this?    Is it still PP Bleeding just late?    Could I be pregnant so soon after having Lilith?    And if I am...

I had light spotting for a day - regular bleeding for a day then light bright red spotting for another then it stopped for two days. I then spotted bright red for a half a day and then stopped for two more days. Last night I started spotting bright red again. I have had bad back pain and some occasional sharp pains in my left side. I am exhausted and over all feel like I have been hit by a mac truck.

TRMT	Hip pain after supracervical lapro hysto	I had my surgery almost 4 weeks ago. I have had a severe pain in my right hip ever since the surgery. I have not had pain anywhere else at all. I did end up with an abcess(abscess)in one incision site. The one near the right hip of course. I also ended up with several large blood clots in my lungs. Nice. I don't understand where these came from as I have not been immobile and they did not show up until 2 weeks after the surgery. I was up walking 4 hours after the surgery ended. I was anemic when I left the hospital, blood down by 23%.The hip pain is excruciating. It has been a factor ever since the surgery. It moves from the pelvic bone to into the hip joint,which seems to lock the muscles on one side of my lower back, and then it will move to the incision site where I will some times develop a large knot about the size of a small egg which goes down with rest. I have not been able to maintain a sitting position comfortably since the surgery. I am an active person and this is driving me crazy. Some days I almost wish the clots had killed me. Any suggestions?	lower back|right hip|incision|pelvic|lungs|bone|hip|pain|active

FAML	early age masterbation(masturbation)	My child aged 11 years is in the habit of masterbation(masturbation)in private. I am worried about his physical & mental health and growth due to this habit. Please tell me whether his habit will affect his growth metally and phhysically and how can i help him to avoid this habit or reduce its frequency. Is there any medicine which can replenish the loss of hormones needed for growth as a result of over masterbation(masturbation).	
FAML	Baby anxiety attacks with loud noises	OK!    So my daughter who is almost 9 months now has always been easily startled and disliked loud noises.    However we proceded as normally we would, hoping regular exposures to normal noises would help her to outgrow it (ie blow dryer, vacuum,)    In the beginning it was so bad she would scream for 40 minutes if one of us even sneezed!    Now she has become accustomed to many sounds but seems to almost have a panic attack at any mechanical type sound.    She starts to shake all over, then she starts to crying, she tenses up and her heart actually races and then proceeds to scream for up to 3 hours even though the noise is gone.    (this happened this week when someone used a mixer in the kitchen).    Any techniques on dealing with this would be very helpful.	shake|sneezed|tenses|heart|mechanical|minutes

FAML	Introducing Personal Health Records	"Hi,Several weeks ago, we launched a new infrastructure for My MedHelp. At that time, we hinted that the changes would help us prepare for the next product release, Personal Pages. A few weeks later, we launched the first Personal Page - a Baby Personal Page. Now we're happy to announce the latest feature using the new Personal Pages infrastructure, a Personal Health Record (PHR).What is a Personal Health Record?A Personal Health Record (PHR) allows you to store and manage all of your health information in one central place, from immunizations and medical conditions to allergies and medications. You can also store emergency contacts, surgeries and procedures, lab test results, your doctor's information, and your insurance information. You can even create PHRs for your family members or other people you care about. If you've ever forgotten what your lab results were and when you did them, or if your child had that chickenpox vaccine, this is a great solution. And it's completely free.How to create a personal page* Go to My MedHelp* Next to the Summary tab, you'll see a tab with a ""+"" in it* Hover over the + and click Personal Health Record (PHR)* Walk through the wizard* Set up any applications you didn't already haveWhat's new?* New Applications: New applications allow you to store personal health information. The new applications include: Personal Info (e.g. blood type, gender, height, weight), Medical Conditions, Allergies, Adult Immunizations, Child Immunizations, Surgeries & Procedures, Medications & Treatments, Emergency Contacts, Doctors Information, Insurance Information.* Reference: Now you can easily search for more information on MedHelp relating to your conditions, medications, allergies, etc. Just click the Reference link from the expanded view of the application.* Secret Question & Secret Answer: We've added a lot of security and encryption for the PHR feature. As a result, only someone signing in with your password can access this information. MedHelp (Harry) can no longer help you with your password. If you forget your password, you will have to provide the answer to your secret question in order to change your password. Anyone who signed up before this release did not create a secret question/answer, but you will be required to do so before you can create a PHR. Otherwise, if you forget your password, you would lose all the data stored in your PHR. This seems complicated, but just be sure that you remember your user name, password, and secret answer, and you'll be fine!Who can see this data?The data in your PHRs can only be viewed by you when you're logged in under your user name. Currently, you do NOT have the option to allow your MedHelp friends or the public view this data. You also cannot invite others to view this data, although we may allow you to Share This page with others in the future if there is demand for it. Even MedHelp admins (like Harry) cannot see the data, unless you explicitly grant MedHelp permission to view this data. In addition, our advertisers cannot view this page or target ads to you based on the data you enter into this page.How do I get help with my PHR?If a member needs help with their PHR, they must first send an email asking for Support and describing the problem through the Contact Us form. Harry will then contact the user and ask them to ""Enable Support"" on their PHR by clicking the link on the upper right on the PHR page. Once clicked, MedHelp admins will be able to view this member's PHR data to help them troubleshoot the issue. Once the issue is resolved, the user can remove the access or access will automatically expire within 24 hours.What is MedHelp's Privacy Policy surrounding PHR?MedHelp has adopted a new Privacy Policy that is available athttp://www.medhelp.org/privacy.htm. The Privacy Policy helps to clarify our position on the data stored in your PHR as well as other data you provide. The highlights are that we won't sell any of your personally identifiable information that you enter anywhere on the site. We may aggregate information, but no one would be able to figure out that it's you based on the data we aggregate. For example, we may say 50% of MedHelp members have allergies, but no one can identify a particular person based on such statements."

SOCL	Partner still does everything for Ex	"My partner and I have been together for 6 and a half years he has two children (7 and 10) from his previous marrige and I have two children (8 and 11) we love each other madly and really consider that we are each others sole mates, but right now things have gotten to the point that maybe love is just not enough.    Let me begin by saying he is the best FAther ever to his two children they have his support in everything which is why I fell in love with him in the first place.    BUT he has taken the ""would do anything for my children"" a bit far and now things are not looking so bright for us.He pays maintence to his ex wife and is never late he pays for all the kids activities and school clothes and stationery - which is in the divorce agreement so I am happy that he takes this responsibility so serious, but his ex-wife does not arrange the stationery she expects him to, she does not take the children for school clothes she expects him to (AND HE DOES) if he forgets to buy a R5-00 pair of socks she phones him and tells him she needs them, she does not use the maintenance on the kids as every week end she sends the kids to us and when they are with us he does not like to moan and we should not shout if they are being misbehaved as that is not how they are raised in their mother's house.    My children who live with us are constantly been told by him to pick up this and do that (which I agree with because it instills responsibility and builds character) but he does not do this to his children when they are there because he wants them to see him as a YES dad.His ex wife stays closer to the childrens school than we do but every morning he gets up packs the chilredn lunch and then leaves to go and pick them up at her house and drop them off at school then he or I collect them from school in the afternoon and drop them off at her house or we bring them home bath and feed them abd then he does ot expect her to collect the kids he gets in the car again and goes and drops them off -I AM JUST CRAZY OR IS THIS JUST UNHEALTHY.If the ex wife actuyally has them for a week end which does not happen often the he up fronts her mony because she has never ever got money but always goes out when we have the kids.    If she has the kids and I suggest we take my two girls to the movies he quickly phones her and asks if she has any plans - she always says no - then we pick up the kids go to movies and when we phone to see if we can drop them off she is out and the kids stay the rest of the week end, if I dare complain he tells me that is it a problem for me if his kids are aroung - I of course say no because I love them but I cant understand why he pays maintence if she never has them and he picks up all the expensesI am ready to walk out - please help"	sole|abd|bath|right

SOCL	venting about confrontation	A few days ago AH & I had a spat... basically I was upset about something (not drug related) he had done and I was upset and it showed. Not spazzing out, physically... that isnt me but I am pretty vocal... but I am vocal about everything and I express my emotions good and bad. This whole situation gave me a lightbulb moment as to why some people love opiates & benzos and others love cocaine, speed, or meth. But that is not the point. From day one I have known that AH doesnt like confrontation and he would do anything to avoid having to deal with a situation like that... distance, denial of feelings etc. Then with the pills came this stamping down of all emotions... good and bad... this numbness or shielding of feelings.    This spat we had came about because he tries to clamp down on my emotions... he doesnt like to deal with my emotions either. Guess it comes with the territory but before he accepted my full on feeling of and expressing my emotions... it is even one of the things he loved about me. Now he shames me for them or will just refuse to acknowledge them. I decided to tell him that this was harming our relationship to the point I wanted to just end our marriage. I wanted to keep the pills completely out of it and not place any blame there... I wanted it to be just 'this is how I feel' and then leave it to him to decide if I am justified to feel this way and if so what he wants do about it. I did get all of that out, no blaming the pills or anything and like a fool let myself get sucked into the whole 'hurts that you think I would ever let myself become a drug addict' and the 'so I have to take a pill every now & then' and I confronted him with a lot of the lies I had caught him in and the insane lengths he goes to to hide his pills... then like clockwork he informs me that he only hides it and lies about it because I am so paranoid about them that HE HAS to hide it and lie about it... just the fact that I had all this proof from my snooping and spying proves it. I admit that my constant searching is borderline crazy. For the record if he was only taking a pill a day or every other day as he says I would not be concerned with this as he does have a hard physical job. I point out that I have asked him several times that if he would just not hide from me the amt or frequency I would be fine with it. When he refuses that I feel he must be hiding because it is more than he admits to and that if he is going to the lengths he goes to to keep this hidden and secret makes this as big a problem for him as my searching is for me.Thanks for anyone who reads it all and any words of advise.	lot|harming|borderline

Now that he's a bit older (18 mos.) we want to try glasses as well as it'll make it easier for daycare....plus we'll be able to leave him overnight occasionally (my husband and I are comfortable putting in and removing the contacts, but wouldn't ask anyone else to do it, it's intimidating to the inexperienced, to say the least).So far, we haven't been too successful at getting our little boy to keep his glasses on for any length of time, he keeps ripping them off (doesn't cry, doesn't get upset - he just doesn't seem to want them on).Any ideas for how we can facilitate this whole process?	bilateral cataracts

SOCL	Suffer These Crimes in Oakland? Don&#x27;t Call the Cops	"Updated 12:17 PM PDT, Tue, Jul 13, 2010Print Share Buzz up!69diggsdiggOakland's police chief is making some dire claims about what his force will and will not respond to if layoffs go as planned.Chief Anthony Batts listed exactly 44 situations that his officers will no longer respond to and they include grand theft, burglary, car wrecks, identity theft and vandalism. He says if you live and Oakland and one of the above happens to you, you need to let police know on-line.Some 80 officers were to be let go at midnight last night if a last-minute deal was not reached.    That's about ten percent of the work force.""I came her e to build an organization, not downsize one,"" said Batts, who was given the top job in October.Famous Mug Shots: Melrose Place Actress Charged in Fatal CrashFamous Mug Shots: Melrose Place Actress Charged in Fatal CrashLOOKFamous Mug Shots: Melrose Place Actress Charged in Fatal CrashMug Shots: Athletes Who Have Run Afoul of The LawMug Shots: Athletes Who Have Run Afoul of The LawLOOKMug Shots: Athletes Who Have Run Afoul of The LawWeird News PhotosWeird News PhotosLOOKWeird News PhotosThat deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. Tuesday.Here's a partial list:* burglary* theft* embezzlement* grand theft* grand theft:dog* identity theft* false information to peace officer* required to register as sex or arson offender* dump waste or offensive matter* discard appliance with lock* loud music* possess forged notes* pass fictitious check* obtain money by false voucher* fraudulent use of access cards* stolen license plate* embezzlement by an employee (over $ 400)* extortion* attempted extortion* false personification of other* injure telephone/ power line* interfere with power line* unauthorized cable tv connection* vandalism* administer/expose poison to another'sNegotiations are going on at Oakland City Hall in the mayor's office.Batts said the 80 officers slated to be laid off - mostly new    officers - are ""pretty sad and pretty depressed,"" and those feelings are    shared by the Police Department as a whole.The Oakland City Council voted June 25 to eliminate the positions to help close the city's $32.5 million funding gap.    According to the city of Oakland, each of the 776 police officers currently employed at OPD costs around $188,000 per year. Most of the officers who will be affected by the layoffs were on the streets of Oakland when Johannes Mehserle's involuntary manslaughter conviction caused riots last Thursday.The sticking point in negotiations appears to be job security. The city council asked OPD officers to pay nine percent of their salary toward their pensions, which would save the city about $7.8 million toward a multi-million dollar deficit. The police union agreed, as long as the city could promise no layoffs for three years. No dice, says city council president Jane Brunner.""We wish we could offer them a three-year no layoff protection we just can't financially. It would be irresponsible of us,"" Brunner said. The city agreed to a one-year moratorium on layoffs, but it is not enough for the union.The problem is money.    In the last five years, the police budget -- along with the fire department budget -- have amount to 75 percent of the general fund. After years of largely sparing those departments the budget ax, now it appears there are few other places to cut.These are the last hours of negotiation and Brunner is hopeful that the city and police will find some sort middle ground.""It's been very good conversation and not a whole lot of grandstanding."" Brunner said. ""There's actually real conversations. Each side understands the problem,"" she said.First Published: Jul 12, 2010 1:27 PM PDTPrint Share Buzz"	Shots|said|waste|cut|lot

FAML	nursery problems	Please help, my daughter will be 4 in march. She started nursery school in Sept 09 full time. She has lovely relationships with a certain few peers and has made other friends. Since starting she has had a few problems with sharing and hitting out at other children, which ws to be expected i suppose, but recently, around xmas has got worse. Her teacher only told us what was going on because we demanded a meeting with her, as we were cocerned about the remarks made by the teachers at the end of the day, saying, shes hit someone, shes pinched someone, and when asked my daughter would say the other child had done it first so she did it back and got told off! she said that my daughter gets very angry and frustrated and doesnt know how to control this so lashes out at others. Im not so convinced. Shes no angel, but before starting school, she was loving, caring and wouldnt hurt a fly. The teacher was having none of this, saying that my daughter was very manipulating and peevish. Im sorry but she has definatly not got this behaviour from home!! She has been on sticker charts, that were never followed through, she'd have good days that were not rewarded by the teacher, so whats the point!!! Theres definatly favouritism going on with other students and im at my wits end as i feel my daughter is being singled out for being a little energetic. Shes very bright and i just dont know what to do. Could she be bored or too bright for school? Is it too much for her to deal with?? Please help x x	back|said|lashes|few problems

My abdominal area has been pretty full, almost like fluid retention (which I am assuming both are from the trigger shot) Yesterday was my 14 day post embryo transfer HCG, and it came back positive (150) The doc where I go, is 3 hours away, and so with there permission I went to a local lab to have my blood drawn, now he is asking that I repeat the test Monday at the same lab or go to his office this weekend.    Any thoughts on why he may want me to come in?    I really cannot find info on HCG numbers 14 day post 4 day embryo transfer. He is saying it's because the labs ""values"" are diffrent from one another, but of course I am worried, and just need to hear some similar experiences, or more solid word that everything is going good.    Thanks in advance."	embryo transfer|soreness|sore|breasts|color|back|My abdominal

DEMO	Bone Age for my 13 year old daughter	My duaghter just turned 13 and is in the bottom 3% for height (56in) and weighs about 74 lbs. They did a bone age on her and it is 11 years? I am 5'4 and my husband is 5'9.    Her 9 year old sis is 53.5 inches.    There are no abnormal labs they all checked out.    Since she is in the bottom 3% I think we have the option of putting her on the growth hormone.    Will this help her grow taller than if she does not take it?    I want to do whatever will give her the most height, and is best for her. It is a little hard on her being the same height as her sister who is over 3 years younger? Any info would be great.Thanks

DISE	Small bump near anus	Hi,A few days ago, I felt a little bump near my anus while cleaning myself. It is of the size of a pea. It does not hurt and I do not have any kind of bleeding. My stools are fine. The only problem and that is giving me nightmares is that I feel an urge to go to the washroom. I read that it was one of the symptoms of anal cancer. I am devastated after reading this and cannot concentrate on anything. Can anyone suggest what it might be. Can it be cancer?Regards,Adam	symptoms|anus|anal
TRMT	lost weight and period stop	"I would like to know what I need to do for my daughter.    She lost 80 pounds started from January 2009 up til now.

She's now weigh about 130 pounds and she's 5'7"" and her BMI is 20.0.    She's in her normal weight range.    Now, she's taking Blue Cohah and vitamin along with her healthy eating, she's still not starting.    I hate having to take her to the doctor cause she doesn't want the doctor to give her a pap smear since she never had one done.    She's 17 years old.    She's eating food that had Omega3 and some slightly high unsaturated fats.    I told her that I'll give her 30 days while trying this and still don't start that I'll have to take her to see the doctor.    I'm sure the doctor will want to put her on birth control pills to get her period started.    Perhap, her hormone maybe imbalance.    She's working during the summer and she had been under alot of stress from school before school let out.    What do I need to do, any suggestion?ThanksLauria"	birth control pills|imbalance|weigh

TRMT	Been there, done that	"I am 32 yrs old.    I had my Abdominal Hyst when I was 30.    Still have both ovaries, but had cysts on that they had to remove.    I had a C-section and just never stopped bleeding afterwards.    Hystology Report said:    unnatural tear in the back of Uterus.    The op itself was very sore.    Everyone said to me that it is similar to a C-section, but it is not true.    After a C-section you have a baby to look forward to and you don't feel like a patient.    It took me about 2 weeks to feel myself again.    I didn't have the opportunity to rest, I had a 3 month old baby to look after.I never, ever miss that time of the month :) but now I struggle with low hormones and get HRT every year.    So, everything has it's pro's and cons.    The only change I have in my sex life is the fact that everything ""runs"" out afterwards... that is a bit annoying, but not so bad."

PREG	Dreams, fears, concerns!	"So, as most of you know, we will be trying for baby #6 starting in early March. If I ovulate right away, it will be on the day of our wedding, given that I will ovulate about 14 days after the start of my menstrual cycle and Day 1 was February14th. I'm just not sure if I had a ""real"" period though! It was very light, no cramps, no PMS symptoms and it started because I took the last of the 21 day pill packet (Yasmin). The reason I was on Yasmin was to alter my cycle. I was supposed to get my period on the day of our wedding and then would have bled for most of our honeymoon. Yuck. I think my cycle will be a little messed up for a bit and that I might not ovulate right away, or when I should or would have. Confusing...I guess my body will do what it wants and it will just be a waiting game, which is so hard!!Anyhow, I have been having SO MANY dreams about pregnancy. I keep dreaming that I am pregnant, buying pregnancy tests and taking them in the store bathrooms and they are all positive!! Night after night I am having these dreams for the past few days. Kind of makes me wonder!! I know it's not really possible, mainly due to the fact that I have no symptoms and I just stopped taking the pill. Not to mention, just got my IUD out on 1/28. Maybe it's just because we have been talking about pregnancy so much and I have been really mentally preparing myself to be pregnant again.I have so many fears this time around. I had some quite serious complications after I delivered last time with dangerously high BP, severe edema and a very low heart rate (in the 30's). Not to mention the problems our son had and spent 3 weeks in the NICU. He came nearly 6 weeks early. My ""advanced maternal age"" scares me, too. I will be 36 in August. This will be my 7th pregnancy (5 live births, one miscarriage before baby #5). I'm afraid of Down's Syndrome, pregnancy complications before and after delivery, complications with the baby, etc, etc...This is more than likely the source of all of my dreams. Has anyone shared these fears when TTC? I feel like a nut!! I just feel like pregnancy now is dangerous for me and I have never felt that way before. Also, does anyone know (and I know this will be a great question for my OB doc) if they routinely do amnio for women 35 and over? Anything else special they do, or does it depend on the doctor? Any thoughts, advice and/or expertise is appreciated. Good luck to everyone TTC, send baby dust our way and HH pregnancy and baby prayers ;)"	pregnancy tests|Down's Syndrome|PMS|pregnancy|symptoms|cramps|body|right

DISE	i know this is serious	I've been put into a few mental hospitals when i was younger and only got classified with AD/HD which shocked me considering what got me in there was when i decided i wanted to break my skull on the ground. i began by doing hand stands and letting my head slam down on the floor over and over. most of the time when i get stressed or aggravated i gain this almost super strength i've broke car windows with my head I've broken house doors just by slamming them. but i have many more problems whenever i had to talk to my father when i was younger i would carry a knife in my back pocket just in case he said something i dident like. I continually think about hurting people but not just hurt people torture them while i share my thoughts and opinions on everything from psycology to politics but recently my bursts of anger have been more sudden and scary i have no friends cause i believe the only reason people have friends is so they can use them at some point in their life. i also find my self very confused from the moment i wake up to the time i sleep but since i suffer from insomnia i usually don't stop thinking i constantly think and i don't know why i'm highly intelligent with and IQ of 184 but ive gotten F's constantly since the 5th grade I'm an adult now and i see where the problem becomes a real problem i can't keep a job for more then 2 months no matter how i try and i find myself screaming and crying for no reason.I also can't seem to stay on one topic or finish a whole topic no matter how i try i continually switch back and forth until i confuse myself draw a blank and get angry. so far while typing this i've gotten up broke my car side mirror and punched myself in the face numerous times. I'm at my wit's end and i don't know where to go from here because i have no health insurance and i can't keep a job long enough to get insurance.        any suggestions on where i can go? I've considered putting myself in a mental institute but i can't stand confiment.also i don't believe that i'm schizophrenic because i'm fully concious but i lose all control over what i do. and it hurts worse when im angry and i don't punch sumthing i'll try to stop but it drives me insane and makes me want to punch it harder and make it hurt me worse the longer i hold back	skull|hand|head|back|face|said|crying for reason

FAML	5 year old advice	"A couple weeks ago my 5 year old daughter was caught asking a little boy to kiss her.    I immediately asked her to come inside and I calmly sat her on the couch and asked her what she was doing outside and what she was playing.    She never told me that she had asked the boy to kiss her.     I proceeded to ask her ""did you ask him to kiss you "" and she said not at first and she said ""I didn't want to tell you because then you'll be mad"".    Right then she obviously new that kissing was not appropraite(even though thtis was the first time that she did it and we have never talked with her about this before).    My second concern is that she didn't feel like she could come to me and her father and tell is the truth on what happened.    We brifely told her that was inappropriate and that we don't do that...very simple talk because we didn't want to make a huge deal out of it.    We then had another talked after we got home that night and told her thatit's always important to tell the truth and that by telling the truth you don't get in as much trouble, if any but by lying it can make things worse.    I also explained that kisses are special and we only do it when we get married or to mommy and daddy and brother and sister.    We tried to make it as clear as can be.2 weeks later we go to my husbands softball game.    That same boy is there.     I trustfullylet her go run around and play but before I knelt down to her level and without even saying anything she said ""i know mom, be a good example and don't kiss boys"" and I sisd good girl your right and let her go one her way to play.    Leter more of my friends boys arrive and they are all playing together.    Later I I have my friend come tell me that Lexi is chasing all the boys asking them to kiss her and play boyfriend and girlfriend.    WE JUST HAD THE TALK 30 MINUTES BEFORE.    I don't know what to do, she knows that we don't like her doing that and that it is a bad choice.    I then confronted her on it and she denied it at first until i kept asking her.    So there are alot of problems here and I need some major help on how to deal with this.    Pleaese help"	telling truth|said|inappropriate|right

TRMT	Need some advice (Clomid)	Ok, for starters...I finished my second round of Clomid on 1/6/12. I started taking it on the 2nd. (3-7) 100mg a day.I did ovulate (a little early) and had intercourse pretty much every day. Mainly ovulated the 9th-13th.Today is the 19th and I have been feeling really irritable these past couple of days. I have horrible gas (sorry!) and today I have this slight/dull cramping going on in my lower abdomen (left side). Almost feels like ovulation cramps but I already ovulated.Anyone who's gotten pregnant, what is the main reason you thought you might be pregnant (besides missed AF of course), anything super early that made you almost positive? I'm feeling pretty good about this round of Clomid. Are these dull cramps normal and could it be a sign of pregnancy? There is so much stuff on the internet, I never know what to believe.Thanks!PS. I know I just gotta wait for a missed AF so I can take a EPT, just wondering though...hoping for something to look forward to.	lower abdomen|cramping|cramps|gas|Today|ovulation|pregnancy
FAML	Five year old and behavior problem	"My five year old nephew has been getting in trouble everday at his kindergarten.    The teacher said he says inappropriate things like ""naked ladies"" , hits other children, won't listen to her and at times won't do work when supposed to.    He even poked a kid with a pencil (he said it was an accident).    When he attended pre-school, it was taught by his grandmother who by her own admission would not really make him mind.    If he did not want to do something the class was doing she would let him go on his own and play.    He was very close to her and she died last May.    When he wasn't with her he stayed home with his dad while my sister worked.    His dad would pretty much let him play video games all day and do what he wants.    Right before he started school in August, my sister left her husband and moved in with my parents.    She moved out in November to move in with her new boyfriend.    She is pretty self absorbed right now with going through her divorce, working and with the new boyfriend.    The new boyfriend has taken on the role of disciplinarian and setting all the rules.    When my sister and her boyfriend are together, they tend to be in their own world and kind of leave the kids (3 year old nephew also) to watch cartoons.    She rarely shows an interest in his school work and puts kids to bed at 10:30 p.m.    When he goes to dad's house on weekends, dad tells him how mom was mean to dad and that she is reason for break-up and allows him to play video games all night.    At school's suggestion she began taking him to a counselor.    Now it has been suggested that he has some kind of attention deficit order and needs to be on medication.    When he is with my parents or I, we never have problems with him.    We set rules and he listens.    Sister keeps saying he is problem child and will probably grow up to be in jail!    My question is that is this normal behavior for a 5 year old that has went through a lot of changes in just a short while.    Or does he need medication?    Sorry for the long post.    Just really upset about what the little guy is going through."	said|inappropriate|lot|right|order
TRMT	Take heed !!!!	I am posting this to warn women of the dangerous side effects that some are not informed of, but get the Mirena and go thru hell. Where shall I begin?    Let's start first with side effects: severe depression, anxiety, weight gain, unexplained pain in ALL areas of the body, hair loss, loss of train of thought, numbness in hands and arms, pain in armpits, lymph node pain in neck, severe headaches, blurry vision, vaginal discharge, pain in butt cheeks, severe cramping, symptoms of MS or Fibromyalgia, mood disorder, crying bouts, loss of libido, malaise, loss of quality of life, bloating, shoulder pain, hear palpitations, tightness in chest, symptoms of heart attack, pain in breasts, unusual fluttering in stomach.....these are ONLY a few of the side effects I endured for 6 months until it was removed today. I had Mirena inserted ten years ago with no problems or side effects and absolutely loved it. A new one was inserted in Feb 2012 and my symptoms started March 28th. They have rapidly progressed, to the point where I have begun the process of planning my own death. These symptoms baffled my dr's and I have been subjected to blood tests, ct scans, MRI's, and x-rays and visits to psychiatry.    I am no longer ME :(. I posted on my Facebook page and asked several of my friends if they have had any experiences with the Mirena, and lo and behold, some are going thru the same experiences as I.    In a matter of 3 days, 4 friends and family have gotten theirs removed.    3 of them going thru similar symptoms and being tested for Neurological disorders, and ALL of them being put on anti-depressants. I hate medication and chose NOT to start an anti-depressant, BUT did pray for my complete and total restoration. The ONLY thing that has kept me sane is my unwavering faith in God, no weapon formed against me shall prosper! I WILL and HAVE and WILL CONTINUE to inform innocent women of the dangers of this horrible method of birth control!!!	tightness in chest|vaginal discharge|lymph node pain|shoulder pain|headaches|cramping|symptoms|malaise|weight|pain|Fibromyalgia|heart attack|disorders|disorder|armpits|cheeks|arms|breasts|stomach|hands|body|hair|scans|severe
PREG	IVF medicaton Questions	I am about to start the lupron and I have only watched a video on were to put the injection. Im not clear on exactly were to put it. Can anyone give me any tips on how to figure this out? Is there a large portion to choose from or is it only within a small area. And do you only give it on one side only? And is the FSH the same side and the same area? I have tried to ask my dr and she told me to watch the video to find out. Any tips or anything you can tell me to make this easier will help me so much. Thanks	injection

DISE	Gastritis/Headaches and  more	Hi, I'm a 20 years old male and i suffer of acute erosive gastritis. I've been tested negative for the helicopter bacteria, although after few months of LANSOX theraphy I'm still having chest pain and burn. I do not have influenza but I feel tired, sick and dizzy all days (especially when I wake up). I also have very intense headaches everyday that start when I wake up. This pain is concentrated all over my head, and on my eyes. I have already tested for new glasses, but that does not seem to be the reason. Im also seeing a chiropractor for my lower back problems, but at moment Im more concerned about gastritis and headaches.I told my doctor about my headaches problem, but she didn't come up with a solution.I've been avoiding such problems for over an year, but now I really seek for a solution.I hope some of you can help me out.Thanks in advance	erosive gastritis|influenza|chest pain|headaches|dizzy|pain|head|eyes

SOCL	Should i trash it all or just live apart and not take chances?	I am about 2 years married with my husband, whom i meant back in college. We have a beautiful little girl and for the past week we have been fighting and ignoring each other to the point i am seriously looking to moving out. Of course, all of this fighting is nothing new. we have done constantly done this restrain or silence treatment during our beginning stages of dating. In the beginning out of no where he would tell me he will call me when he wants to. He would tell me how he wished this girl he had a HUGE crush on the best because she deserves it, or that i was lucky i was there that night we went out or else he would of hit on a girl he was checking out that night. He even told me one day that if he would of seen me at the night club he wouldnt of approached me at all. He even told me about a dream he had about her and him telling each others true feelings and trying to work something out. Then about a girl who played him and had his first sex encounter with but never went through completely.Then he would tell me what type of girls he was into and even showed me the picture of his huge crush. She was the typical music girl ( big boobs, butt, pretty face, thin waist, and beautiful from head to toe. which i wasn't. I am a 5ft tanned skin girl with short brown hair and average figured) of course, i felt hurt but still stayed with him. One day i finally got the guts to end it all and break up with him. that night he told me he loved me and he convinced me we could make it work. After that day my feelings for him changed. He said he loves but when he saw the website the girl who played him out his face was gloomy, and his face changed more when he saw his former's crush webpage. My love for him got twisted and pretty much didn't care as much as i did before to the point i would flirt, talk with other guys, and even dated a few times another guy. Inironically, he fell deeply in love with me and I was blessed i became pregnant with my baby. This is the part it will sound horrible to anyone who reads this. I decided to get married because I wanted my baby to be born inside a marriage.    While i was going through my pregnancy he would want me to cook for him, take care of our puppy. When I would ask things for me it was an issue but his family always had the upper hand when it came to money. Don't get me wrong my inlaws didnt ask for it but his cousins would approach him with their sob stories., After our baby was born I started working and my desire for other men attention was always in my mind. One day I we were moving boxes around and saw the picture of the his crush. When i saw it i felt disrespected that he still had that picture but made nothing of it since we were trying to mend things.One day we had a huge fight and i cheated on him all the way. We went through the motions and stayed together. Everytime i would try to leave him to start my own line again without dragging this marriage anymore i would get back with him and would start again. It became a cycle with no ending. My personal insecurities would now and then come a float and i would either remind him of what he had said to me in the past or a girl he messed around with and affected him. This week when I went to look for some papers we left in a container at my mother's house i saw the picture of the girl he had a HUGE crush on. I honestly didn't get mad. I actually felt heart broken and sad because even after all these years of being together he still has the picture they took together at a nightclub. When i confronted him about it he said that he doesnt care about that picture and if i want i can rip it up, but that picture was enough to make me realize how insecure i feel about how he looks at me and how i look at myself. The next day i gave it to him and told him if hes going to keep it to keep it out of the house but i don't want to see it. He stared at it for a few seconds and then ripped infront of me and said he doesnt care about that picture or that girl because nothing happen between them and he knew alot more about me in 1 day then he did about her. Deep down i wanted to believe him but i couldn't force myself to believe it. To be very honest i didnt even cry a tear that day. A few days later he wanted to know what we were going to do to solve this issue. He wanted to know if we were going to divorce or what i wanted to do. We finally came to the conclusion i want to move completely out of my state. he accepted it as long as the baby will be fine. a few hours later he called me but i was at work. when i called back he said he had an urge to call me and say something. i could hear in his voice he was hurting. When i heard that my heart softened up again and I was tempted to go back with him. I am so confused because one part of me is ready to move on even though it will be very painful, but another part of me wants to stay with him because i got used to being with him and i know if we get divorced i wont want to be with anyone else because it will be a constant reminder of what i did have and the chances i am taking with a whole other person. Should I just move out and take some time apart without a divorce or should i just move out and keep moving forward?	treatment|remind|crush|reminder|painful|sob|stared|said|ending|pregnancy|waist|back|face|heart|head|hair|guts|hand|toe|one part
DISE	post viral syndrome question.  (although I have MS)	"Prior to my MS diagnosis in 1998,..all the drs kept saying I had a post viral syndrome. Does that have any bearing at all now that we know I have MS?....It was very confusing to me at the time. My symptoms at the time were diarrhea for 8 days straight , followed by diplopia (double vision) 6 days later,..followed by paresthesia that started in the feet after an ""unexplained"" fall which progressed within days to the T-3 level (chest).    The drs were stumped as they kept insisting post viral syndrome. I was finally diagnosed with MS about 8 months later. My question is this,...What was all the talk of a post viral syndrome when it would up being MS? Now that we know it is MS, does post viral syndrome have anything to do with this or they just didn't know? Even with the small white matter lesions on the MRI they were saying they believed post viral syndrome rather than MS....Lastly,..Can my diagnosis with certainty now rule out post viral syndrome? These are things I have always wanted to understand.I would really like a doctor to tell me detailed thoughts. Thank You."	post viral syndrome|paresthesia|symptoms|were diarrhea|diagnosed|chest|feet
DISE	supplements	"due to UNbelieveable continual stressful events in our family over the past year or so.....I think we are sitting under a black cloud or something, my palpitations come and go. In the past 2 months, they have been horrid. I even took myself to the Emergency Room one morning, where after extensive testing, they said PACs, PVCs..stress..etc...So...they continued, not every day, but most days, off and on.....Soo..I waited a week or so, and went to my cardiologist. HE put a 48 hr holter on me, and wow did i have the palps!!He first just sent me a letter, said the Holter was NORMAL. I called them back, I said NORMAL???? I knew that I mustve had thousands of them, and he says normal??!Well, he returned my frantic call...and said to come on in to discuss.I did, he said he saw PACs, few PVCs, and SVE, which I just learned on this forum are the same as PACs, in other words...all harmless, but that i had 4,300 of them in a 24 hr period. Wow. He didnt say wow, tho. He was unimpressed. He said TO LESSEN MY ANXIETY OF THEM, and because I seem to FEEL them more than most people, he would try some things....Im on Metoprolol already, the Extended release. 100 mg in the morning. He said take another one at night. Thats 200 mg a day!!Then Ive been taking, by prescription, Potassium (which for a while I thought was the ""cure"". NOPE.) I take the potass 15 ml (liquid) 2x a day.He then wrote a prescrp for 500 mg Magnesium, and I was told to take 500 mg calcium. So..hes really trying to help me, I know this.I dont take all that stuff tho. It seems like way too much for me!!! I tried the Mag a few times...never the calcium...and never the full 200 mg Metoprolol a day, I cut the PM one in half.QUESTION...should I ignore my thoughts,and go ahead and take ALL that he has told me to??? I know he knows more than I do..but that seems like so much stuff.I work out at a cardiac fitness center because my husband has cardiac issues (im only 49,hes 52 but has had heart troubles) so when I have the palps bad, they insist on putting on a monitor and watching mine. Well, 2 nights ago, I went in to workout WITH The palpitations. She put the monitor on me, and wow, did I have them, again. But she didnt stop me, and when I got done, she showed me the tracings...and said, its all PACs, absolutly NOTHING to be worried about...but I wake up this morning, and they are back.what should I do? There are NO more doctors, hospitals left to go to! Am I a hypochondriac now??? These things reduce me to tears....and to going from Dr to Dr....and thats just not me"	cardiac|heart|cut|liquid|said|PACs|watching

I stopped them a year and a half ago (Feb. of '07) and I'm sure it takes a while for our bodies to regulate themselves & get ready to sustain a pregnancy, but I was wondering how many of us are out there.    How long were you on bcp's, when did you stop taking them & how long have you been ttc?Thanks, ladies !!! :-)	discussion|pregnancy
FAML	Child flails arms 4 yr ild	My 4 yr old over the last year, has started to flail his arms wildly and at times violently in all directions.    The movement is very random and very aggressive at times.    When he does this his head will often times violently move with his body and his eyes always seem to focus to the right.    These behaviors are starting to concern us and we are wondering who the best person would be to take him to see.	arms|head|body|eyes|right
DISE	HERPES AND YOUR PERIOD	I have my doctor's appt on Monday but right now I am truly afraid. For the past couple of months, either the day of my period, day before my period, or during my period, I would have bumps appear in which one would get swollen with blood and bleed (the others will sometimes get filled with blood or stay small). The bumps are on the side of where I had an abscess drained last year. Once my period is over, the bumps go away with no scabbing. They do hurt if I pee too hard. I use a condom at all times and right now I don't know if this is Herpes or something else. The fact that a menstrual cycle can trigger herpes doesn't help at all (since this is when the bumps only occur). Please help.	abscess|Herpes|herpes|and right|right
DEMO	Bleeding after a miscarriage	HiI recently experienced a miscarriage on Oct.5, 2007,I immediately had a d&c.    I've been bleeding since.    I've been to several Dr's and no one can determine the cause.    I was also diagnosed with fibroid tumors.    I'm anemic and will need a blood&fluid transfusion soon.    Last week was told that the fibroid are not the source of my bleeding.    My bleeding is clotted, heavy and has a foul odor.    A friend of mine say she experienced the same symptoms following her giving birth.    Since the miscarriage, I've been unable to handle any situations without getting emotional and feeling bitter.    My boyfriend and I broke up and he's abandoned me and have not been really supportive.    I'm really stressed out and a lil depressed.    Do you think that stress and a traumatic experience such as a miscarriage can cause bleeding.    after the d&c, I expected some bleeding but this has been non stop.    Ive been put on the tapered birth control method, hormone therapy nothing works!    My flow is heavy, constant and painful,	transfusion|hormone therapy|diagnosed|symptoms|painful
SOCL	Path to enlightenment	"{This is a story i wrote if it doesnt belong in this group sorry}A women prayed for days but her prays went unheard so she meditated for a month yet she could not find him. The wise man had been said to been siting on a rock pillar in the center of there village. She practice the rituals and did all of the teachings yet he still had not shown himself to her. The wise men of the village said they had seen him and spoke to him. They said his wit was of fools and his knowledge was that of a donkey.One day while the street was crowded and she could not find any room she decide to go for a walk. In the nearby forest she came to a river and say a perfect place to do her daily ritual. She knelt down and offered a seed to the soil she then began to meditate once she felt connected to the source she then prayedshe lost time and place but could not loose self she could not find enlightenment. When again found place and time the moon was over head and a man sat across from her the man wore a mask and his clothes were tattered. She stared at the man confused and unsure who he was and what she should say. She simply stood up and bowed to him as she walked off.She came again the next day to find the man had taken the place had been sitting only now there was a tree there. She was unsure if the man wanted company or if she would disturb the stranger who was obviously one who had given his life to this practice. A peach fell from the tree into the mans hand; he reach his hand out to hand it to her. She had been thought not indulge in worldly needs before prayer but it was as rude to decline an offering of food from someone who was without. She took the fruit and took a but the man offered her a place beside him. A unusual practice since under a peach tree was a place for only these who had found enlightenment but again to say no would have been rude.    The man waited for me to finish the fruit before resuming his meditation once he began i also began.""Tell me why to you wish to meet ""the wise man"" "" he asked in a strange voice. The voice was soft but yet it pirece though you like an arrow. It went straight to your mind and made you excited. In the same moment it would then calm you and make you pounder every thing and nothing.""I want to become enlightened."" i responded""Why do you want to become enlightened?"" he preceded to ask.I thought for much time. I wanted to ask how he had known but he could have asked any of the villagers they all know or perhaps he just figured. I then preceded to say""i want to be enlightened so my life will matter and i may be happy""""Your life is part of all life weather you are enlightened or not""""happiness is a moment and nothing more"" the man responded""Why have you come here"" I asked him""I came here to meet you"" he said""What?! Who are You?""""I'm The Wise Man and I have come here to speak with you""""Why me?"" I preceded to ask it more just sliped out""I came here because i knew soon you would be ready to hear what i have to tell you""""I shall tell you about enlightenment. Every one will tell you this is the one path to it and that all other will lead you astray. The truth is there are many paths and even the ones that lead you astray will always come back to the end. All of life begins in the same path and all will end at the same point. I once walked a path of Self loathing and Foolishness but it lead me here thus it was not all bad. The source/god/goddess/mother/father they all set you onto the plain with with no direction for it was meant for you to find your way back to them.    When the source finds you wandering from life it gives you signs/blessings/dejavu's to help you find your way. No path is without a light and marked pathway. When you walk off of it you will only find your way to another""I could only listen to him speak. I had wanted to hear his wisedom for so long""I could tell you thousands of wisedoms but they would mean nothing to you. You must find your own path to enlightenment."" The wise man looked up""Look to the sky, so much yet nothing this is much like all of life there is so much up there but we only see it when it shine with stars or storms with clouds. as Children we see the world with true eyes we see the designs in the clouds and they mean so much. To see all the beaty of this world and to being one with it are both important. You search to lose self but yet you have never tried simply embracing the self. Truly loving who you are and all living things. You saw this world as an illusion but its here and is reflecting not just you but everything. That is life and it connects us all.""I had never thought of all this but yet it felt true to me i had forgotten the faces in the clouds i had gotten so use to trying to let go or to indulge in rituals that i had forgotten that there was this world all around me and it was beautiful""What must i do?"" I askedhe look to me""You must do everything and yet nothing. You must enjoy life and for fill your needs but you must not be lost in them. You must look to the world with love not with pain and hate. You must not stop praying but you must not let it rule your life. You must balance all things and when you fall and you shall for we all do. You must learn and study why you fell then once you know continue on your journey.""""Why dont you tech this to others?"" I asked bodly""You have so much wisedom why just me?""He removed his mask and under it was a young mans face. he looked to me and smile. At that moment i say it in his eyes I saw the source of all things. I began to cry and i could not stop my chest was warm and my stomuch turned.""in the ten thousand years I have lived I have learned one thing that is never failing and never stops being true. We are all connected and when one life is touched so shall all lives be touched . Next time you shall touch someone    and they may not take it in but it will effect them some way some how. Now go our paths met here but now they shall separate. Perhaps they may meet again but for now they shall break"" He stood up put back on his mask and walked off""A fool i must sound like, but a fool i am.

DEMO	Three years of excessive wiegth gain in my 9 year old	"I am posting in this particular forum becaseu of the timing of my daughter's issues with excessive weight gain, behavior issues and the timing with several shots before she started kindergarten. She is now 9. Since she started school at 5, she began gaining wiegth with no explaination., gaining nearly 20-25 pounds in less than 18 months between K and first grade with no diest changes.. She had always been very petitie and in the lower end of the growth chart in first two years...She was a good eatter and never picky.    Her behavior had noticably changed. Often losign focus and ""drifting"" off and not listening. She was certainly not ""autisitc"" , very talkative actually, but had a hard time with impulse control. She is bright but very emotional, along with the wieght gain that cannot be controlled with diet and exercise. Her blood work by an endocrinologist recently showed high prolactin levels, but no evidence of a prolactinoma was found in an MRI. Her vision has also deteriorated fairly rapidly within a years time this past year.Within three months of a series of vaccinations before starting school, her weight gain and behavior issues started. It may be important to note, she had to restart a a three shot hep series since she missed a third shot within 6 months in the first round . II was assured it would cause no harm to start over again... Now I'm not so sure if this and the regular, last series of shots she recieved to register for school, did not have something to do with her endocrine problem... Has there ever been a correlation to mercury levels in vaccinations and endocrine system issues in children? I am going with my gut and knowing how my child's body and mind totally changed after her last vaccinations. She continues to be active, we wtach carefully what she eats, but she gains on average, 2-3 pounds a month."	endocrine problem|weight|body|gut|and endocrine|and exercise|vaccinations|active

FAML	Child Too Sensitive???	I have a precious 2 year old boy.    His mother, who has BPD, and I have been seperated for almost a year, although since learning that it is possible he is autistic (after professional evaluation) I have been living back in the home for 3 months and take care of him almost 24/7 while his mother works at night and sleeps during the day.    I have a definite connection to this little boy and have a hard time believeing he is autistic.The other day she had the chance to read to him and rock him before putting him down for bed.    While she was reading the book to him she came across a part where the teacher was telling the student not to do something and the student began to cry.    He pointed to the child who was covering her eyes and the mother told him that the child was crying at which point he began to cry himself.    I see this as a very sensitive child who was in touch with the emotional part of the story and began to act it out.    Mom freaked out and thinks he needs therapy.    Is this normal for a child to do? or is mom over-reacting?	back|eyes|act|definite|therapy

I worked many, many, hours as a registered nurse so she could have everything.    For quite a long time I worked 72 hours (or more) at 2 full-time jobs so she could have as much as her 'rich' friends.    At age 16 she went into a mental hospital for constant fighting with me- acting out horribly.    Her father threatened me 'to get her out in 24 hours or else'.    The DR said she was exactly where she needed to be.    He told me she lied (I already knew that one!). told half truths, blamed outcomes on other people.    She was there for 2 weeks, and it was the best thing I ever did.    Life with her was wonderful for a few years- then the old ways started creeping in.    She is now 35 and the past 5 years (she lives in a different state) have been hell.    I am the scapegoat for EVERYTHING!!    She is rude- constant little comments, which are exactly how MY mother would talk to me.    My daughter saw that and even asked why grandma was always so mean to me.    I had no good answer.    She has filed bankruptcy at age 21.    She then had a good job with NBC TV in San Antonio, TX.    My mother died in 2003.     I was hurt severely at work and am disabled.    I got a settlement.    I gave her $40,000 with the stipulation that it was for a deposit on a house ONLY- we ta;ked about how I was leary about letting her have the money in her account because of her history of bankruptcy.    There was also the stipulation that if I needed it for medical bills and she hadn't bought a house yet she would give it back.    After 5 months, my medical bills started getting very high.    She hadn't bought a house.    I asked for it back and after she didn't send it she told me she 'spendt it all'!    I had a fit.    A big one.    To try to shorten the story, she blames me for everything- she recently told me she believes I took her inheritance money from my mother.    That was easy to fix- I got a copy of the will from the lawyer and sent it to her- guess what- she HAD NO INHERITANCE!    She now says that the new Toyota that my mother and I bought her for college was only paid for by my mother- that I didn't pay for any of it.    That is a lie- she knew at the time that we split it 50-50.    I KNOW she knew it at the time. He response is: ""That's not how I remember it"".    That seems to be her response to anything that I have ever done for her.    She did her first 2 years of college at home at a community college.    Of course I did NOT charge her rent or ask her to help with ANY expenses that applied to our living, ie house payment, utilities, food, etc.    She did have to pay her own insurance for her car.    During her last 2 years at Orlando, I was working for the Federal Government in Public Health at Indian reservations as a nurse.    My house that we had lived in was for sale, so I had to still pay my house payment, and also pay rent on the house I was living in at the reservation- and no- that wasn't cheap- the rental was about $500/mo.     So, I had 2 house payments.    It took about 15 months to sell the house.    Because of this, I didn't have much extra money to send her.    I did send a little almost every month or every other month-maybe $25-50.    Once, after the house sold, I sent $500.    She tells me I sent money only 3 times.    Her car was in both our names- mine was listed first on the title, so when she would run through a pay-highway, and the camera caught the license number, the fine was sent to me. $70!!    'I didn't have 25cents.'.. was her excuse. She has never come to see me unless I paid her airfare.    She goes to see her father many times, so it is plain who it is that she loves.    I am in so much pain and hurting- I worked my *** off for years so she could have everything- I had crap for myself, but I made sure she had the best.    Once I did buy myself a GOOD pair of shorts/sweater.    I hadn't worn them yet, and when I came home from work one day they were laying on the washer/dryer- they had been washed/dried and totally ruined.    She lied and said she thought she would do my laundry for me (they were still on the hangers- never worn yet).    She had worn them to school-she was about 16 years.    There are soooo many things that she has done to me.    I know reading this you might think it is trivial, but it has continued- the lying.EVERYTHING ends up being blamed on me- it is always MY fault.    When my feelings are hurt, she blames me with not dealing with my parents abuse- it has nothing to do with what she has done- she is responsible for her own acts.I finally saw a therapist several times- I was being stomped into the ground exactly like an alcoholic does to their spouse.    The therapist told me that what happened to me in my early years has nothing to do with the irresponsible behavior of her.Without being able to talk to my daughter herself, the therapist says she belives there might be a couple possibilities- that she has 'Narcississtic Personality Disoprder, An anger disorder (can't think of the name right now), or possibly OCD with Borderline Personality Disorder (due to the trichotillomania).I have been beaten down so much that I was beginning to believe I was the one that was severely sick.    The therapist made me realize how manipulative she is.    Also, that I have never had any support system.    No wonder all I do is cry, feel like it IS my fault.    The county I live in has lost 2 therapists, so I don't have anyone to see right now.    I hope there will be someone soon.    There is NAMI, which has a Family Support meeting monthly, so I will go to my first one January 6th.What can thoses of you who know what I am going through guide me to do?    I am heartsick, have terrible 'pain' because of her.    I hate her, yet still    love her somewhat because she IS my daughter.    Right now I am not supposed to have any contact with her.    I have to read 'Stop Walking on Eggshells' as a homework assignment.    I ordered it yesterday.I don't know if I have done the damage myself by raising a spoiled brat- or if I should feel sorry for her because she is sick. (and when mentioned to her that she might be ill there was another rage). How do I start to heal a heart that hurts so much?    I have prayed for years- and it has only gotten worse.Thank you for taking time to hear me- I know it is long-and that is just the beginning...."

TRMT	A HBV patient&#x27;s request of his doctor.	2007 AASLD Guideline for chronic HBV offers IFN and antiviral drugs as treatments. IFN has such strong side effects that my ability to drive and work cannot be assured and its cure rate is 4% or below. Antivirals such as Entecavir (Baraclude), Telbivudine (Tyzeka), Tenofovir, Adefovir (Hepsera), lamivudine (Epivir-HBV) have less upfront side effects but their long term consequences hurt patients even more: possible lifetime dependency, resistence issue, cost burden, toxicity, possible link to neuropathy, nephropathy and cancer, etc. With all these consequences the cure rate is a miserable below 1%!    That is why I choose to manage my chronic HBV with foods, herbs and adjusted life style. And I need my PCP to help me monitor the results of my effort.	treatments|neuropathy|PCP|nephropathy

DEMO	Spotting Before Per	Here's the scoop.    Last March I gave birth to my second daughter.    My periods used to be normal before having her.    I am nursing, and my periods came back about 7 months after she was born.    However, I was experiencing spotting 3-4 days continuously before my period.    I had never had this before, and it was a concern as well as kind of gross.    Well, last month my husband and I decided to start ttc for #3, so I am gung ho on my prenatal vitamins and started taking magnesium, vitamin b6, flaxseed oil.    Well, month no. 1 there is no baby yet, but the good news is that my spotting went from 5 very heavy spotting days to 2 very light spotting.Has anyone else run across this?    A lot of what I'm finding on the internet says that my progesterone and estrogen levels are probably uneven, and I'm guessing that nursing may add to my hormone levels even though I'm only nursing 3x/day.I'd like to hear what has worked for others in this situation.	nursing|finding|back|lot

SOCL	Weird flesh coloured bumps on forearm?	I posted this question yesterday but didn't get specify enough so I am re-posting. I have a series of small bumps on my forearm that are not itchy, flesh coloured, a little pearly looking?, and dry-looking. They HAVE NOT, as I've said, itched, been painful, or grown in size. They go up to the inside of my upper arm, there are only 6, they look like bug bites but are not, again, itchy. The one on the inside of my muscle and on the inside of my elbow look like a rash. They've been here for a few weeks, pushing a month. I've been putting Vitamin E lotion on it, which seems to help, they reduce greatly in size after that . It just came out of no where. I'm thinking it might be a seasonal thing but I don't know...I'll be going to the doctor soon if it doesn't go away, but I'm a little concerned (understandably so). I don't have allergies but I do have a slight sensitivity to polyester, which I have been wearing more frequently but I thought I grew out of the condition as I got older. They have gotten a bit red given it's been incredibly cold (no power on account of the hurricane). This morning I put on Vitamin E lotion and have been wearing cotton and they again seem to be diminishing. Any help/insight would be great.	condition|said|forearm|arm|painful|rash|slight sensitivity|elbow

Is there a way to diagnosis the problem?? And safe, natural treatment that works?? ( the show sold a product ).Is her theory true- 85 % of the population???

She is the middle child between an 11 yo girl and 7 yo girl.I have tried point systems, ignoring the behaviors, praising for handling situations without crying, extra attention, channeling into creative and physical activities (art, dance, singing, piano, sports), etc etc.She cries at least 5 times a day- usually more like ten. She often yells for myself or her sisters to ""stop looking at me"" and takes everything very personally. She is also physically sensitive to cold, drafts, dust, clothes (won't wear clothes with tags) and is very particular about the way things feel in general.She eats very healthy food, better than my other girls, lots of fruits and vegetables.She is academically gifted, seems to have a photographic memory, and once focused on something like dance or piano, is very tenacious until it is mastered.She usually can control the behavior in front of strangers and her peers, but is getting worse at that.She feels like she gets less attention than her sisters.I am a stay at home mom and none of the children have ever been in daycare."	control behavior|yells

DEMO	Wifes choice to have husband present for exam ?	Hi,My wife recently had an appointment with a new doctor to renew her birth control pill prescription. She is 30 has been on the same pill for the last 10 years, all that usually happens is her blood pressure is checked and she is given a 6 month supply.We have recently moved here and have no established relationship with any doctors or health care providers; I accompanied her to this appointment at her request as she did not know the doctor and my company medical insurance would be paying any costs.At the appointment in his consulting room he confirmed that he could renew my wifeÃ¢ € ™s birth control prescription but that first he needed to conduct a physical examination, he then asked me to leave the room. I started to get up to leave but my wife said she was happy to have an examination but wished me to stay, the doctor said that this was not Ã¢ € œallowedÃ¢ € .My wife insisted that I stay, she did not know the doctor, who was an older man and my staying would she said help her relax and make the examination, if it was really necessary, as stress free as possible.Let me say at this point that I was happy to stay or go and wait outside as she wished I had no preference other than her wishes.The doctor however refused to allow me to stay, my wife argued a little with him and repeatedly said that surly it was her choice if she wished to have her husband present for the examination, we both left with out her having the examination or getting the prescription for her Birth control pills.My wife went straight to the reception/administrator to complain about the way she had been treated,    to our amazement instead of getting an apology we were told that    is entirely up to the doctor who he Ã¢ € œ allowsÃ¢ €  to be present during any examination.The administrator then did offer to arrange another appointment the following week for my wife with a female doctor, my wife agreed but said that she still whished me to be present for any examination if one was required ( I think by this stage it had become a pint of principle)    to our surprise my wife    was told    again that this would be completely up to the doctor but the administrator though that is would not be allowed and was against the Ã¢ € œrulesÃ¢ € ..At this point we left, angry, frustrated and upset, my wife had still not been able to refill her birth control pill prescription which had been the whole point of the visit in the first place.My wife has subsequently contacted a couple of other doctors, explained that she wants top refill her Birth control prescription to protect against an unwanted pregnancy, they both said she has to come in for a consultation, which she is happy to do but both have refused to confirm to her that she will be Ã¢ € œallowedÃ¢ €  to have her husband present if any examination is required.    Apparently is depends on the Ã¢ € œpolicyÃ¢ €  of Dr X or the Ã¢ € œRulesÃ¢ €  of Dr Y.We have had    very little dealing with the medical profession as we are both fit,    health and active in our early 30Ã¢ € ™s but I    have to admit my wifeÃ¢ € ™s recent experience has been frightening.Surely she is correct that it is HER choice who she does or does not want to have present for any physical or personal examination. It is not up to what the Dr Ã¢ € œallowsÃ¢ €  or not or what his Ã¢ € œ policyÃ¢ €     is ?If my wife or any patient wants to have their husband present during an examination, surely that is the patients right and doctors should respect that, not completely ignore it.?As I said I have no strong person view    with this other than wanting to respect the wishes and preference of my wife,    I would be happy to accompany her or not, to wait inside or out as she wishes but surely it is her right to make that decision.I would welcome any medical / legal comments or opinions on this.ThanksJames	said|fit|active|right|correct

FAML	4 year old girl crossing legs for pleasure or problem?	I recently noticed that my four year old girl has been crossing her legs while lying down and wiggling around a lot.    When I ask if she has to go potty, she says no.    I also noticed that she often tucks her blankey or a little pillow down between her legs at night, and I suppose she is doing the same type of rocking and wiggling around.    I suspected a possible rash or something, as if she might be itching herself, but nothing seems to be the matter.    Could she have a bladder or yeast infection of some sort?    Is this just for pleasure (I read about other preschooler girls bouncing on the edge of their chairs, etc...).    That is almost what it seems like to me.She is most definately not abused in any way and I don't feel that it is a stress or tension type behavior.    She has been going to daycare for a couple days a week and I'm wondering if she might have seen this from another child at school (they nap on cots).Should I discuss this with her or let is pass?	yeast infection|bladder|legs|lot|chairs|tucks|rash|potty

SOCL	He is having a midlife crisis and just walked away!	Hi everyone, I just found this site and loved it! I so need to vent! This past year I almost lost my son who is 32 three times,,,he has bi-polar disorder and got deeply depressed going through a divorce. He also self medicates with alcohol and just about anything else he can find to numb himself. My daughter who is a dream child decided that she will not talk to me if her brother is living with me because he drives her crazy! I don't blame her, I'm going crazy too, but it's not easy kicking your hurting child to the street! In the middle of all of this my fiance decided after seven years he wasn't in love with me any more,,,he just loves me like a sister! I had noticed some unusual behavior, new cologne, new look, etc. So, needless to say I am now a nervous wreck! I shake, I cry and I have to force myself to even function (my doctor does not believe in giving anything for nerves, except an antidepressant) So what do I do when I just tremble all day and night?. I am unable to work, I can barely make it to the grocery store without a huge crying spell. I never know when the next bomb will fall. We just got through the Easter weekend and it was a weekend of uncontrollable sobbing by my son because he misses the boys, but is not able to have them untill he is stable. Between my son's rages/depression and morning the loss of the love of my life I simply feel as though I will not be able to come through this! I have always found comfort in prayer, but I'm not finding any lately. Is it possible that I have had so many losses in a years time that I cannot shake it off? It is devastating to watch my grown son cry and miss his boys,,,I miss the boys too. I long for the comfort of my fiance even though he just walked away and never looked back. After seven years of him telling me that I am his soulmate and the love of his life,,,he leaves? To be fair, we had a long distance relationship and me not being there for him just made him give up I guess? I know that time will heal and I will realize that I'm an idiot to miss him, but right now I am in a tremendous amount of pain with no relief in sight. I welcome any helpful advice.	unusual behavior|nervous|tremble|finding|shake|spell|pain|disorder|nerves|back|right
SOCL	could this be a syndrome	my daughter is almost 3 and has struggled with FTT since birth.    She is 21 pounds and 32 inches, she has a high pitched voice and hypertonic muscles.    she has a very cute face with a broad nasal bridge and wide forhead.    her head circ. is normal.    she had a gross motor delay but with therapy seems to be on track now and also seems to speak pretty well.    she does not seem to be lacking in the intelligence area.    i am just concerned that they have not found an answer for her growth problem.    she also has very 'odd' joints (i.e very large, knocked knees) and seems to move very stifflike.    as a baby she had many respiratory issues but now rarely has any health problems except for the FTT, eczema, chronic constipation and some wheezing with colds.	eczema|colds|gross motor delay|knees|head|face|therapy

DISE	burning,tingling and pain...just a few of my symptoms	Hi there, I am a 33 year old mother of 2 that was healthy until recently. I have many symptoms with no explanation. It started a year and a half ago with a pinch like sensation is my rib cage. Several X-rays completed with no findings. Within 4 months, I returned back to my MD and tried to explain that I had a burning sensation that was interminent throughout all parts of my body arms, legs, chest etc. Several blood tests and ultrasounds complete with no findings, other than a slighty reduced platlet count. 2 months after that..I had to go to the hospital because of the intense pain in my head. The pain is not your typical head ache pain but instead the pain is similiar to what I am describing above (burning and tingling) but with way more intensity. I literally feel like something is burning my brain, and at times, it feels like someone just inserted 10 needles into my scalp. The pain is not localized. Sometimes it is a the top of my scalp, other times it is in my forehead and/or by my ears. A CT scan was done, that showed 2 possible lesions. An MRI was done 2 weeks later that showed nothing other than sinnusits. I was told that sinnusitis would absolutetly not cause any of the pain.I also had a bone scan done which should minor minor arthritis. My doctor said it was so minor not even to worry about it but to be proactive now by excersising regularly.I now am getting shooting pains in my shoulder blades (both sides)...and I have an appointment with my doctor next week to discuss the newer sypmtom. At this point my MD has openly admitted that he does not know what the problem is. He's been my MD for over 15 years so he knows the only time I'd see him is if something were seriously bothering me? I am confident this is not in my head as I can feel the pain. I have tried some nerve medication (lyrica) which did nothing for me. The pain is really really starting to scare    me. I have tried to stay positive and have a positive outlook, but the positivity is beginning to fade. Any advice or recommendations would be so greatly appreciated.	burning sensation|head ache|symptoms|burning|pains|pain|findings|ultrasounds|bone scan|CT scan|rib cage|brain|scalp|nerve|body|legs|head|ears|forehead|chest|back|arms|shoulder|minor|said|arthritis|tingling|proactive

FAML	7-8 years old child Fear of being alone	Hello all,I have a nephew who is in 1st grade. When he was a 1 year old, he was naughty child, despite my warning he was playing in a dark room. I tried the close the door but the handle was broken. I warned him not to go there so I got angry and I locked the door for few seconds then I opened the door. He cried and kept on crying for more than 10-15 minutes. Now, the child is 7-8 years old and he has a fear of playing alone in the crowded parks. He needs one of his parents to watch over him. The problem is that his parents blame me for their child behavior that he needs one of them to watch over him while he is playing in crowded parks! He plays fine with children around his age and he goes to school with no big problems apart for wanting to play all the time. Now, if I am the one who cause the problem HOW to fix his fear. If I am not the cause, how can I explain myself to his parents? How to make them believe that I am not the cause! I believe it is normal for children to be afraid and need their parentsÃ¢ € ™ attention on crowded parks. I am I wrong? Kindly, advise this case is giving me sleepless nights! (I just realized (on New Year eve) what his parents were thinking about me for the last 6 years!	15 minutes

FAML	Blended Family	Seeking balanced recommendations.My husband and I have been married for 2-yrs. We both have been married before and have children from past relationships. Currently, my 14-yr old son and his 14-yr old daughter live with us. While my son has challenged things at time, the major concern is with respect to my 14-yr old stepdaughter who is rude, displays poor manners, argumentative, non-compliant and uncooperative. She seldom responds to requests or instructions from me, and whenever I address a situation with her, my husband interferes and is non-supportive.    Further, he has criticized my approach, and in turn openly stated in her presence that he does not see it the way I do.    As a result, her hostility and inappropriate behavior has increased.On two separate occasions with two different adults, she has stated that she is going to do whatever she can to break her father and I up.    99.9% of our marital disputes have been over the children, specifically his daughter. Her behavior is beyond normal teenage attitude.My step-daughter has had past experiences prior to my involvement in her life in which I believe are very real factors in how she is behaving. In her motherÃ¢ € ™s care, she has been sexually active, has had little to no supervision, no family structure, and not provided with even the most basic of decorum. While our home has the potential to present a much more stable and structured environment, my husband appears to be shying away from really addressing these issues.When my husband and I travel, we take the children to their perspective parents. During our trips together, my step-daughter calls excessively, sometimes 8-10 times/day to talk to him about this or that. I realize sheÃ¢ € ™s being manipulative, yet he sees no problem with it. This situation alone is stressful. Coupled with other past relationships involving children and mothers excessive calling, text messaging, and emailing numerous times a day, sometimes makes things pretty challenging.

FAML	i need help badly.	i have an 8 1/2 yr old daughter.    i have been split from her dad since she was a baby.    she was potty trained at 2 1/2 and never had any serious problems.    over the last year and a half so she was 7 yrs old, she wets her clothes all day thruout the day, pees in the bed every night, and is even defecating on herself almost everyday.    i do see her go to the bathroom but when she goes in her clothes she hides it.    she has been going to counseling for over a year now and is a relatively happy child .    she is sensitive though.    i took her to see a urologist and they did a renal ultrasound and he said that it was common for kids to wet the bed.    he rushed me out and was so busy trying to be done i didn't think to bring up the defecating on herself.    he told me not to make her feel bad about it.    so i have told her please tell me if u need help or change your clothes and wash up immediately if u use the bathroom in your pants, due to she gets rashes alot.    she has a terrible one across her whole butt right now and i know it's from the poop.    i have her sleeping n a pad at nite, and i can deal with the cleaning up part, but i don't want her to get picked on.    its very upsetting.    she said she cant help it and cries and cries.    she is over weight by about 20 pounds, but she is active and a normal kid, straight a student every year , girl scout, t ball player . and very artistic.    my 5 yr old daughter has begun wetting the bed and thinks its ok because her    older sister does it.    what next step should i take??    i am desperate for some ideas.    please help us.

SOCL	Male Orgasm Without Penis Stimulation	This may be interesting to you all. Since I was a teenager (I'm in my 20s now) I've been able to orgasm in a way I've never heard from anyone else. I'll explain in a second, but first I'd like to know if this is just myself or if you've heard of it.Here is what happens: I'll be laying by myself on my back, side or belly, with my hips either pushed forward a little or backward all the way, with my knees pointing inward almost as far as they can go. All I have to do is squeeze together my thighs as hard as I can and with hardly any movement - just enough to find the 'sweet spot' - I'll start feeling a pleasurable pressure building up inside the lower part of my my pelvis, which results in an orgasm very quickly.The penis isn't in contact with anything during this whole process (unless I'm laying face down, in which case the contact is minimal if my pelvis is pulled back, up in the air). In fact, even if I'm only slightly turned on or the erection isn't full, squeezing will force an erection, and climax follows very fast. Intense arousal does make it easier, though.Has anyone experienced or heard of something like this? My theory is that squeezing the thighs creates enough pressure inside the pelvis to squeeze the prostate, stimulating it into orgasm, but I have my doubts about this theory. My prostate doesn't get stimulation in any other way, and its position doesn't seem to be anywhere near the thigh bones.Let me know what you think. Let us all know. Thanks.	prostate|penis|thighs|thigh|back|face|pelvis|knees|bones|hips|20s|stimulation

FAML	Is This Normal	My grandson whom I have raised for most of his 5years was recently taken from me by his mother.

FAML	8 yr. old daughter	"My 8 yr. old daughter was diagnosed with selective mutism at age 4. She was in pre-school, and she was put on paxil. She stayed on it for 2 yrs. Within 2 wks. she was able to talk to other kids at school. She always talked ALOT at home with immediate family, but to no one else. She had colic as a baby. I guess she has always been the ""difficult"" child. I love her so much, but her behavior now at home is so mentally and physically draining. She almost seems to have a split personality, which scares me to think of possible bi-polar? She takes over the whole house. I have a 13 yr. old son who can't even really have a conversation when she is around. The minute she doesn't get her own way , she is so nasty. She tells me she hates me daily, she hits me, she pinches with her fingernails and leaves marks. She refuses to do what is asked. I have tried so many things, I feel like a bad mother. But my son does not act this way.One minute she's a little angel, so sweet and loving. Always hugging and kissing me. The next hating me! She does not act up at school, and does well academically. I want to take her to a    therapist but I doubt she will speak to anyone.[she still does not speak to adults really] I can't find a pedi. specialist. Does this sound like bi-polar?    I need help!    Also when she was younger she would have such tantrums that she would actually throw up and hyperventilate. Even through all this she is VERY attached to me. She wants to sleep in my room every night and taells me she loves me    alot throughout the day. I don't know what to do.

SOCL	Boy Scout files reveal long history of child sex abuse cases	"(Reuters) - A popular Colorado Boy Scout leader named Floyd Slusher allegedly had a strategy when it came to molesting boys: He first plied his victims with alcohol, then abused them and threatened to kill anyone who talked.On one occasion in 1976, according to police, Slusher told a Scout as he undressed the child that ""what I'm going to do now, if I get arrested, after I get out of jail, I'll come after you and your family.""It wasn't the first time that he had been accused of abusing a Scout - an investigator later concluded there were too many victims to interview - nor was it the first time that Boy Scouts of America leaders had been told about the alleged assaults.They had placed Slusher on ""probation"" four years earlier after he was accused of molesting Scouts at a camp in Germany.Slusher, who was convicted of sexually abusing a child in 1977, is among those named in 1,247 files on suspected and convicted pedophiles that the Boy Scouts kept from public view until Thursday, when they were released under a judge's order.The roughly 20,000 pages of files lay bare disturbing incidents of child sexual abuse within one of America's most respected organizations between 1965 and 1985 and illustrate its long struggle to keep pedophiles out of its ranks.""We failed some of our kids and we have to say we're sorry,"" Boy Scouts of America President Wayne Perry told Reuters. ""There are cases where we failed to live up to our standards, failed to properly document cases, and fell short in other ways.""KEEPING INCIDENTS QUIETSince at least 1919, the Boy Scouts has maintained the internal files to keep suspected pedophiles from re-entering the organization. But in a number of cases, the files show, the organization failed to take proper steps in suspected cases of abuse.The organization currently requires even suspected cases of child molestation to be reported immediately to law enforcement officials, conducts criminal background checks, and prohibits one-on-one contact between an adult and a Scout. The group now rigorously trains volunteers and leaders to spot signs of abuse.Local police were involved in nearly two-thirds of the 1965-1985 cases, according to a recently-released analysis by the Boy Scouts.But in scores of other cases, local Boy Scout leaders urged accused and admitted pedophiles to quietly resign without notifying authorities, or allowed them to return to scouting after being treated by doctors or clergy.In one case, the files show that after a volunteer in Texas was expelled when he confessed to molesting Scouts in 1965, a local Scouting official wrote to the national office and said a minister that knew the man ""is doing his best to protect Boy Scouting and trying to keep this incident as quiet as possible.""However, if some parents file charges, of course it will come out into the public.""In 1980, the files show, another Colorado Scout leader was accused of sexually molesting three Scout brothers. He was arrested and charged with sex abuse after the boys' father went to police. Months later, the father learned the man - out on bail - had been allowed to return to Scouting.""I know that you are concerned about (him) filing a defamation of character suit,"" the father wrote. But ""in my opinion, (the abuse arrest) should be evidence enough to remove a man from Scouting.""In the mid-1970s, an Indiana Scout leader admitted to molesting Scouts and agreed to be treated by a psychiatrist, according to the files. He was allowed to return to Scouting after his psychiatrist and minister said he was ""cured.""Years later he admitted to molesting two more Scouts and resigned, according to the files.Boy Scout officials and attorneys have said the files represent only a tiny fraction of the 1.1 million adult volunteers and leaders who mentor more than three million Scouts annually.Still, they represent a black eye for the Boy Scouts.They played a key evidentiary role in a 2010 civil case in which an Oregon jury found the organization liable for $18.5 million for failing to protect a Scout from a ********* in the 1980s.An Oregon circuit judge ordered the files released. The state's highest court upheld that order in June, over objections by the Boy Scouts. A similar court fight is unfolding in Texas over Boy Scouts files created from 1985 to 2010.SOURCE: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-usa-boyscouts-abuse-idUSBRE89H0ZF20121018"	arrested|arrest|Still|said|order|unfolding
TRMT	Unsure of treatment of iron anemia after D&C	Hi, 46 yr old female who recently suffered heavy menstrual bleeding and just had D&C performed.    Bleeding is under control now.    I had been telling my gyno how bad I felt and he was like, okay.......so before my procedure they finally checked my iron and CBC.    My hemoglobin was 7.8 and my iron percentage was at 5.    Every value on iron or CBC was abnormal.    So at my insistence he gave me an IV iron infusion after surgery and started me on biferax once a day.    A week later I can barely walk through house without having to sit and rest.    My blood pressure is like 110/65 quite a bit lower than normal for me.    So I call and go in yday and he isn't concerned about bp or rechecking values.    He said only thing to make me feel better is transfusion (which I don't want).    He said he could do venofer iv infusions every other day @400mg.    Should I go this route?    I'm considering a hematologist.    He didn't think I needed to see one but I'm not so sure.        He doesn't want to even see me back or check any levels for 8 weeks.        I also tale montly b12 injections and vitamin d(always low)    they hsvent even checked them at all.    I have 2 businesses to run and a family, I'm afraid this is going to be a bad summer.    I	transfusion|injections|procedure|infusions|infusion|said|back

DISE	Lower Back, left leg pain	"I was in the Army for 3.5 years and just recently ETS'd, during my service I had severe lower back, leg, knee, and shoulder pain. I was 165 pounds 5'8 and in pretty good shape physically. I always blew off my pain even when I fell getting out of bed on the floor and couldn't move for 15 minutes with ever muscle in my body spazzing out in just a horrific way. My lower back seemed destroyed at time where i couldn't even stand straight but throughout the day it would get better so i never bothered with it. My right shoulder was so messed up any amount of weight on it like a backpack my whole arm would go numb within minutes. My knee would give out just walking at a normal pace and it would feel like my whole leg would give out with any amount of weight put on it. Anyways I had shoulder surgery and it helped a little but I still have alot of pain in it. I asked the military doctors about my leg and knee and they did x-rays and MRI and they said they couldn't find anything but a little extra fluid in my knee. As for my lower back they just said i'm too young I was 23 at the time(25 now). Pretty much all the doctors say it's just muscle aches, which i know is complete bs honestly. I also then developed difficulty breathing when sleeping and started having crazy chest pains and back pain. And the doctors just tell me it's muscle aches... Now i'm forced to sleep on my back because of my chest pains, but because i'm sleeping on my back my lower back and left leg seem to be getting worse with every day. The pain is so bad i can't roll over in bed i can barely move. when i finally do get up after sucking up all the pain i have to literally claw because my left leg will not function to even hold any weight. The other day it took me nearly 15 minutes to get to my bathroom in the morning and it's not even 50ft away. I couldn't even suck up the pain to move my body literally wouldn't let my leg function. Anyways I know this is a long post and all but I would really like to know if anyone else has similar problems and are left with the words from the ""wise"" ""it's only muscle aches"". (was taking varies medications for pain and antiflamatories they didn't do much other then numb some of the pain, but under the numbness I could still tell the problem still exists."	shoulder surgery|15 minutes|severe|fluid|minutes|right shoulder|lower back|chest|back|shoulder pain|and back pain|muscle aches|weight|pains|pain|backpack|left leg|knee|body|claw|leg|arm|varies|said
GOAL	Options after wrong IOL is implanted	What can be done after the wrong IOL is implanted during cataract surgery? My surgeon was suppose to give me distance vision in my left eye. (This was discussed and confirmed before surgery. I'm a photographer and need my distance vision and this is my dominant eye) After surgery, I complained that my vision had not improved from 80/60 except it wasn't cloudy. He admitted it he gave me monovision instead of distance. I had never worn glasses before except for a prescription of +25 for reading. Right after surgery I could read perfectly without glasses. I am now wearing a contact in that eye and my reading glass prescription is up to a +2.25. The surgeon told me he could correct my vision by doing radiokaratotomy in his office. The optomistrist that referred me to my surgeon said that I should not have that procedure. Should I look into Lasik surgery? Is it more difficult to do Lasik after catarct surgury? Should my close up vision be changing this quickly?	cataract surgery|procedure|implanted|left eye|said|eye|correct

The dog's owner said he had been missing for 15 hours before the dolphins alerted neighbors.Cindy Burnett says her 11-year-old Doberman named Turbo disappeared late Sunday night after his gate was left open.And that's when Burnett and her sons went looking for him.""I searched and searched and called his name. I drove through this street at least five or six times,"" she said.Late Monday morning, Turbo was finally found.""He was shivering and a lot of distress,"" Burnett said.She says Turbo could have been in the canal water for 15 hours. And she says it would have been longer if it weren't for a persistent splashing coming from the water.""The lady here who had gotten him out of the canal said, 'No, the dolphins were with him,'"" Burnett explained.Dolphins got a neighbor's attention - alerting them to a stranded pooch in shallow water.""If he had to tread water all night long, I know he wouldn't have been able to,"" Burnett said.The neighbor jumped in the water after calling 9-1-1 and got Turbo out. But she wasn't home Wednesday when we tried reaching her.While Turbo has been reunited with his family, Burnett says she doesn't expect him to get too close to the water any time soon."

TRMT	calming anxiety	There are several supplements that are quite useful in calming anxiety. But most important is to avoid food additives that increase anxiety, such ascaffeine and food additive excitotoxins, including MSG, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, soy products, natural flavoring, caseinate, etc. Also, avoid sugar,since sugar precipitates hypoglycemia in close to 50 percent of the population and is know to dramatically increase brain excitability.As for supplements, there are several. One that I have found most useful is theanine, which is an extract of green tea. It has been shown to calm thebrain and improve memory and a sense of wellbeing. The dose is 200 milligrams to 400 milligrams twice a day on an empty stomach. L-carnosine(not L-carnitine) also calms the nervous system and establishes a sense of well-being. The dose is 500 milligrams twice to three times a day, alsoon an empty stomach. Magnesium also calms the brain and many people are deficient. The dose is 500 milligrams twice a day. It has also been shownthat low levels of vitamin D-3 cause irritability and that raising the intake can lower excitability. New recommendations suggest at least 2,000international units a day of vitamin D-3, the active form	excitability|nervous|stomach|brain|active|sense|protein

GOAL	Eyelass loss,among other eye issues	A couple of years ago, I started to notice how gritty my eyes would get at night.    I told my boyfriend it feels like the sandman is going crazy in my eyes.    It was the first time I noticed that kind of symptom.    It has progressed and now it's every night and by 10 p.m. I have to close them even with all the eyedrops I use.    12/08 I started to get lumps on the lids.    They would alternate from eye to eye.    An opthamologist said she didn't know what it was so she had her associate look and all they came up with was a possible allergic response to something even tho I had told them about the dry, gritty feeling at    night.    They told me to gently swab the eye in the mornings coz of the goo that I'd wake up with every morning and they gave me an antibiotic salve and the lumps seemed to get better until one got so big and painful and wouldn't go away for anything.    I went to a homeopath who gave me 2 remedies and they actually worked.    One was to soften the lump, the other was to disolve it.    Within 48 hours, I awoke with some blood and goo in my eye and the lump had reduced!    It took some time for it to disappear completely, but I couldn't believe how well it worked.    However, the dryness has gotten progressively worse.    Since I haven't been using any eye makeup since 12/08 I only noticed this in the last few weeks, but I have hardly any eyelashes left.    I haven't been rubbing them or anything.    If it was from the gentle 'swabbing' in the morning then what would have stopped them from falling out when I did wear makeup and removed it every night with vaseline and much harder rubbing?    I used to feel my lashes on my eyeglass lenses they were so long.    Now they're almost gone and I'm really upset.    Oh, and my friend just told me that the lids are swollen also.    If this is some kind of allergy, why are the lashes falling out?Thanx for listening!	eyelashes|eyes|eye|symptom|painful|said|lashes|homeopath|antibiotic

He is a very smart boy, it seems like when I tell him no he completely turns on me, tells me he hates me etc.    I've tried all the disiplinary stuff, time outs taking toys away sitting in his room can't go outside, nothing works.    I've tried many of the tecnices (I know I spelt that wrong lol) that I've seen on super nanny and I just can't get anything to work.    I've tried sitting him down and explaining to him that when he's mad he needs to talk to me about it instead of the way he's doing things now, he says he understands and doesn't know why he gets so mad.    He was physically abused by his father and hasn't had anything to do with him since he was 3.

GOAL	bug in eye	Last night a bug flew in my eye.    I was able to get it out but it kept burning.    This morning my eye was swollen shut, and the pain did not go away.    Should I consult a doctor, or should I just wait it out?	burning|pain|eye
GOAL	Blurry Vision in one eye after wake	Hi :)Just this morning I woke up with blurred vision in one eye that only lasted for about an hour then returned to basically normal. The blurriness wasn't that bad or anything i just noticed it when I felt my eye feeling a bit like it had pressure applied to it.    The pressure feeling stayed longer even after the blurriness went away. I also wear glasses/contacts sometimes too. The only things I can tell you is the past few days Ive had a bit of a headache above my forehead and around my eyes. Yesterday also I was in a very minor car accident. There was not much damage at all to either car but my car did jolt a little as I was hit from behind. Last night I developed a little bit of a headache but didnt think much of it because i had one the day before and there was a bit of pain behind one eye (the same eye that I woke up to have blurred vision in). I stressed myself out entirely last night thinking I had internal bleeding or injury to my head which may have brought on the feeling of sickness. I threw up once but felt completely fine after that. I suffer from anxiety as well.This morning though I didnt have a headache or sickness feeling or anything just the blurriness in one eye.What do you think it could be? Should I be worried? I havent had any other symptoms besides these either.Thankyou for your help!!	sickness feeling|sickness|symptoms|pain|have headache|forehead|minor|eyes|head|eye
